Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town. Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs. He said it was important that "immediate steps" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans. Have you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders? 
Insp David Gibson said: "It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second. 
Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer "did a good job and I didn't". After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap. But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session. Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done. Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: "Q1 was what I was expecting. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake. 
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983. 
Dr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years. 
Simone Favaro got the crucial try with the last move of the game, following earlier touchdowns by Chris Fusaro, Zander Fagerson and Junior Bulumakau. Rynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons. It took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards. Debutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try. 
At the time of the crash, she was on her way to work in a hotel. The remains of the bus stop, which was extensively damaged in the crash, have been removed. Flowers have been left at the site in tribute to the victim. 
"The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders," Team Sky's Rowe said. "There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes. Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium. 
He said: "It is heavy mentally to accept that." Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in "weeks" rather than months. He told BBC Sport: "It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. Gundogan said: "Optimism for the season is big. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start."

The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a "dongle" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research. Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice. 
There are hopes some of the workers affected could find posts at another building firm in nearby Melrose which currently requires staff. 
The EC said that its "preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid." The Commission said it had "no indication" that the tax arrangement was "compatible with the internal market". Luxembourg's finance ministry said it "has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation."

Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008. Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached. However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.

He said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls. Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger. Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory. 
She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend. "The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection," she told the BBC's Network Africa programme. "In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously," Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying. 
But there is scepticism over whether such a deal would make much difference to the current oversupply of oil in the market. Shares of Apple dropped 2% after a report suggested the company was cutting iPhone production in the April-June quarter due to weak sales. 
That is the conclusion of a study by US biologists, exploring how the colour is created in different tarantula species. "If the genus has at least one species that's blue, we say that's a blue genus," Mr Hsiung explained. They used electron microscopes to zoom in on tiny shapes within the hairs and conducted simulations of how those shapes could produce a "structural colour" by reflecting - very specifically - this wavelength of blue light. "That's one of the reasons why it must have evolved so many times - because we don't see a very clear pattern of how these different mechanisms split," Mr Hsiung said. "It evolved from multiple origins and different mechanisms produce the very same blue colour," Mr Hsiung said. 
The German prosecutors said internet searches made on the tablet found in Lubitz's Duesseldorf flat included "ways to commit suicide" and "cockpit doors and their security provisions". Based on that evidence, investigators said they believed Lubitz intentionally crashed Flight 9525, which was travelling from Barcelona to Duesseldorf, taking control of the aircraft while the pilot was locked out of the cockpit. The "completely blackened" equipment was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks, he said. He said: "The second black box is an indispensable addition to understand what happened especially in the final moment of the flight." Also on Thursday, Germanwings said it was unaware that Lubitz had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot. 
He said his entire shifts, not just the on-air periods, constituted a "full performance" and colleagues would often make playful comments to one another. Referring to the "horseplay" in the office, Mr Fox insisted he would never have engaged in such conduct if it was not consensual, "otherwise it would create a bad atmosphere in the studio". Asked whether the culture of radio had changed during the past 25 years, he said: "I think the workplace in general, it's changed, hasn't it? Asked about that, he said: "That would be wholly wrong, totally disrespectful, and it's not something I would do." The complainant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has also said Mr Fox once pushed her over and simulated having sex with her. Mr Fox told the court he had seen it "many times", but agreed that out of context, the "Benny Hill-style" comedy could have seemed inappropriate. Mr Fox agreed it would be "quite wrong" for an adult man to "stick his tongue" into the mouth of a teenage girl, as the woman alleged he had done in the station's car park on another occasion. If a young fan asked him for a kiss, he would respond with "a social kiss" on the cheek, he said. 
Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said the 20-year-old would be out for "a few weeks" after leaving him out of his squad to play Arsenal on Sunday. 
Sewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder. But what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house. Because of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases. When she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men. This bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a "judicial committee" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice. The Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme. Karen Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies. For both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group. Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house. The case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse. For young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family. 
Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will "go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever". He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign. But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states. 
The IPC opened proceedings against the National Paralympic Committee of Russia after a report claimed the country had operated a widespread doping programme. "I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward," said Craven. But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit.

She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government. He said: "There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves." Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne. "The Welsh Liberal Democrats approach will be to continue to get our economy moving and improve the quality of life for people in Wales," she said. 
The former Tory prime minister also called for "more charm and a lot less cheap rhetoric" from the UK government towards the rest of the EU. Downing Street said the government was determined to make a success of the UK's departure from the EU. In a speech in London, Sir John, who campaigned for a Remain vote in June's referendum, claimed there was "little chance" the advantages of being part of the EU single market could be replicated once the UK leaves. Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe. Sir John said Brexit talks require "statesmanship of a high order" and warned of a "real risk" of the exit deal falling "well below the hopes and expectations" that have been raised, saying he doubted the "rosy confidence being offered to the British people". 
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Labour - which is opposing the cap - was "in denial" over the state of the economy. The coalition argues this is necessary to reduce the deficit, and is fair at a time when public sector pay is being capped and salaries in the private sector are rising below the rate of inflation. But Labour, which opposes the cap, says it will result in a real-terms cut in support for millions of working people. Despite the concerns of some Lib Dems, the coalition is thought likely to win the vote. Glance at the spreadsheets and the scale of the saving is apparent. They increased 5.2% this year and without the planned change would have been set to rise by 2.2% - the rate of CPI inflation last September, on which the figure is calculated. He added that the gap between the rate of income inflation between workers and the unemployed had "grown" in the last few years. However, Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes told the House: "It's difficult but the government has got the right and I believe, after this parliament, it will be vindicated by getting more people in work and fewer out of work." 
Network Rail and Thames Water engineers are at the scene after the hole appeared in Forest Hill on Monday. It said the repair work was "extremely complex" and that engineers had located the problem section of the sewer and were working to seal it. Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working "as hard as possible" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour. "It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. 
Everton had won on their last four visits to City - and for an hour frustration was in the air again as they mounted a wall of well-organised resistance that kept Roberto Mancini's side at bay. The introduction of substitute Mario Balotelli on the hour led to the breakthrough as he scored with a deflected shot after 68 minutes and finally unsettled Everton with an impressive cameo. It was the type of result and performances that adds weight to the argument that City will mount a serious title challenge this season Moyes also believed Everton had been the victims of injustice in the build-up to Balotelli's crucial goal, claiming City were wrongly awarded a throw in. Balotelli's finish from the edge of the area was measured and also took a decisive touch off Everton defender Phil Jagielka to send the ball tantalisingly out of Howard's reach into the bottom corner. 
Ms Sturgeon's office said she would not be revising her remarks because the six-week target had been met in the past. She said Ms Sturgeon had told the SNP conference in 2011 that patients spent 200,000 days in a hospital bed when they did not need to. In the middle of a flood of stats, Ms Sturgeon said: "Having delivered the target of zero delays over six weeks, we have progressively toughened that target." The immediate response from the First Minister's office is that the target - of zero delays over six weeks - had been met in the past. Dr Simpson said that the six-week target had been missed in every month since 2012. He also said that official statistics showed that more than 4,700 patients had been delayed more than six weeks despite being fit to leave since 2012, and nearly 400 in the past two months alone. But a Scottish government spokeswoman said: "The first minister was correct that the old six week target was met, on a number of occasions, under this government. 
Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar. Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary. A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020." Welsh Water added: "We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away." 
Pope Francis - the first pontiff to hail from Latin America  - is credited with helping the recent thaw in diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US. He also called on Cuba and the US to "persevere on the path" of detente. The Pope said he was in Cuba to "support and encourage the Cuban people in their hopes and concerns". Cristina Fernandez Kirchner, president of the Pope's native Argentina, also arrived on the island on Saturday and will attend the Mass in Revolution Square. In the city of Holguin where the Pope will celebrate Mass on Monday, the cathedral has been repaired and repainted.

Sunderland claim speculation about Allardyce has been "extremely damaging" and have urged the FA to "bring about a swift resolution to the matter". Sunderland said they agreed to let Allardyce speak with the FA as a "potential candidate" after he requested permission, but are upset discussions did not remain confidential. He knows how to get the best out of a player. He surrounds himself with the best people in the best roles, which allows him to plan and get the best out of his squad." "I think he has always thrived on being the underdog and I think England are going to go into a lot of games as underdogs in the future, so it probably will suit the way England are at the moment. " Allardyce is not the only Premier League manager linked with the England job. United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann and former England manager Glenn Hoddle have also been linked with the job, but Allardyce is the frontrunner. Eriksson's assistant Steve McClaren got the job instead but he failed to guide England to qualification for the 2008 European Championship. It was the right time and the right job for me but not from the FA's point of view. For me to be interested in the England job, Roy would probably have to leave at the end of the Euros. 
All the tries came in the second half with Liam Williams and Gareth Davies crossing as Wales twice opened an eight-point lead. Following their 32-8 defeat by Australia the previous week, Wales were relieved to hang on against a Pumas side that refused to buckle in the face of extreme pressure. And while Howley would be pleased with the improvement in Wales' performance, a lack of composure in attack, particularly when they were on top in the first half, will be a concern. When referee Angus Gardner finally lost patience and sent prop Ramiro Herrera to the sin-bin with a minute of the first half remaining, Wales were promptly penalised at the next scrum and went in with a three-point lead which barely reflected the run of play. After the break, wing Williams produced a tenacious finish to edge Wales eight points clear before Landajo's opportunism from a quick penalty created a try for the superb Hernandez. 
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England. Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: "These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future. 
An internal prison report seen by the BBC says the the inmate ran down a landing with the keys at HMP Wayland. 
Of course I am not just backing him to succeed at Villa because I used to play with him - the reason is that, since the earliest days of my career, I have always seen him as manager material. Character is a bit of a buzzword these days, but as a player I looked around for team-mates who had the ability to handle pressure and Tim was always one of them. He always had the leadership qualities you need as a manager and, on top of that, I always thought he was extremely knowledgeable about the game. So it does not surprise me that, as a manager, he has got the best out of players who had been under-performing - like Emmanuel Adebayor at Spurs or Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph at Villa last season - because he has always had the ability to get people playing for him. You have to take into consideration that he lost his two best players over the summer in striker Benteke and midfielder Delph, who were both inspirational for him last season, and realise he is trying to build a new team with all the signings that Villa have made. They have plenty of potential, and also plenty of sell-on value which seems to be a big part of the club's thinking, but it is a gamble whether they work out for Villa now and that is Sherwood's problem. Sherwood has chopped and changed his team and formation a lot so far, but that is only because he is trying to find the right balance between attack and defence while he beds those new signings in and finds a system that works with the players he has got. The choices he has to make with his current forwards is an example of how difficult that is. 
It was one of a number of local authorities reporting a big rise in rejections, after being told not to just rely on evidence from GPs. 
Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease. In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important. "Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country," he said.

The son of bricklayer Matosinhos Otoni da Silva, Mr Menezes was born in the town of Gonzaga in the state of Minas Gerais - a source of many migrants to Europe and the US. Mr Menezes moved to Sao Paulo to live with his uncle at the age of 14, attended high school and became a qualified electrician. "When he was a child he said: 'Father, I heard on the radio people make good money in England, the United States, France. The Home Office said Mr Menezes had been granted entry to the UK for six months as a visitor on his arrival on 13 March 2002. On 22 July, the day Mr Menezes was killed, police and soldiers had been watching the block of flats in Tulse Hill, where the electrician lived. It is thought Mr Menezes left his flat, which he shared with cousins Vivian and Patricia, in order to fit a fire alarm. In the days that followed the shooting, a makeshift memorial to Mr Menezes was set up outside Stockwell Tube station. The jury rejected the police account Mr de Menezes was killed lawfully by two officers and returned an open verdict. 
Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m.

North and his fellow Wales wing Alex Cuthbert scored the Lions's tries in the 23-21 win in Brisbane. "It was a remarkable win and a remarkable result," North said. We won and I got my first [Lions] Test try. "It's always good to get a win, and while it was tough towards the end we are delighted to have got that first win in the series. "I felt it was a try.

"The medical staff could not give a clear prognosis for Marco," Low said of Reus's omission, which comes on his birthday. Liverpool midfielder Emre Can, Arsenal's Mesut Ozil and former Gunners attacking midfielder Lukas Podolski, now at Turkish side Galatasaray, have all been included as the world champions search for their first European title since 1996. 
Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness. Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation. Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its "financial situation". 
"I believe I can [win], and that's a great feeling to have," Higgins said. "It's the best place in the world to get out and play and I can't wait to get into the arena tomorrow [Thursday]. Yet Higgins is in a good place mentally as he prepares for the semi-final. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. In the last few years he's grown into a great champion, because he always had the game and he's got the belief now." 
Mr Wilkinson, then aged 16, said he spoke to Pte James about 20 minutes before he heard she had died. Mr Wilkinson said he did not try to avoid being seen while the pair talked and he was just sitting in a chair in the cabin while she was on guard duty. He was eventually seen by a major and told to leave because he should not have been with Pte James while she was on duty, the inquest heard. The inquest heard that was the last time Mr Wilkinson saw Pte James. Ms Foster then told Mr Wilkinson the major was certain he had not marched him away and asked: "Were you aware that you needed to sort out some sort of alibi?" But Mr Wilkinson denied he had tipped Pte James over the edge. 
The jury was told he took them to a Bishopsgate flat, where he spanked the younger girl and had sex with her. He gave a total of Â£480 to the teenager and her friend, which he says was for "travel expenses". They arranged to meet and Mr Richard made a payment of Â£120 through PayPal, the court heard.

His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report  by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices. An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size. Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a "scrappy entrepreneur" to be more like a "leader of a major global company". One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an "opportunity to reboot". 
Work on the new bridge is planned for May, which includes raising the road surface by 30cm to accommodate the larger arches. 
The title pacesetters would always be able to recover from a bad result - but how would they cope with the exclusion of their firebrand top scorer after a training ground bust-up and suggestions of interest from China? Mauricio Pochettino's side are a growing force in this title race and the 4-0 demolition of West Bromwich Albion was further evidence of their growing authority. It was their sixth straight league win since their loss at Manchester United in December - and they have only lost two games out of 21. They ran out of steam towards the end of last season, but Pochettino is a top-class operator who will surely have learned his lesson and tailored his team's intense style accordingly. The disappointment will come because they were within six minutes of securing a win that would not only have inflicted even more damage on United, but also would have sent a strong message to those nearer the top of the table. Even at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday they made a slow start, but it is hard to argue with a 4-0 away win. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants the Gunners to stay in the title shake-up until the closing stages - and they are certainly doing that so far. They cannot be ruled out but it is hard to see where they will pick up the points to haul in Chelsea. Only five teams have a lower haul than City's tally of four clean sheets and they have conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their past seven games. Manchester United are showing definite signs of improvement under manager Jose Mourinho, but like neighbours City their fight is now for the top four rather than the title. United have drawn seven league games - including five at home - and the simple fact is they have squandered too many points to make up the deficit. 
Last August, McGregor was banned from driving for four months and fined Â£400 after being caught driving at 69mph in a 50mph zone. 
"It was a tough one, especially to go down in the fourth set after serving for it and having two set points," Evans told BBC Radio 5 live. The last point is always the hardest one and I couldn't get that last point of the set to take it to a fifth. Defeat was not far away for Evans at 4-4 in the third but he got the vital break with a sharp backhand volley, pumping his fist as he made his way back to the chair, and served out the set to love with an ace. From standing on the verge of a fifth set, Evans was now serving to stay in the match, and a wayward drop shot and a double fault brought Robredo to match point. 
His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a "rarest of the rare crime", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India. Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. 
The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday. The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold. A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank. Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan. 
The study suggests water may be stored deep in the interiors of many rocky planets. The observation is the first physical evidence that water can be stored in the deep interiors of planets and solves a 25-year-old controversy about whether the deep Earth is dry, wet, or wet in patches. It implies that the interior may store several times the amount of water in the oceans. "This discovery implies that hydrogen may control the interior processes of the Earth just as it controls the surface processes, and that water planets, like Earth, may be common in our galaxy." 
Peter Whittle said he would back Paul Nuttall as "a leader who knows the party inside out and who can command the loyalty" of all members.

In the court filings, the organisations said that there was "no adequate justification" for the FBI to continue to withhold the information. It added that it hoped that the government would share with the company any vulnerabilities of the iPhone that might come to light. 
Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years. I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here The French flair - I used to laugh at that. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final. "It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family," he explains. "One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. "Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. On the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. "We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through," Cotter recalls. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit." It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says. "It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is." "I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here," he explains. "We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game. "It's been a privilege, the whole thing. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on." In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road. 
Honduran President Porfirio Lobo has ordered a safety review of all prisons as experts try to establish the causes of the blaze in the Comayagua prison. Pathologists continue to try to identify the bodies of the victims, but said many were so badly burned they could only be identified through DNA testing. The other was the wife of a prisoner who had come to visit her husband. 
The Willow Tea Rooms inside was a separate business and had to relocate. 
Mrs Obama confessed she had only ridden in the passenger's seat of a car once in the last seven years. 
After Kyle Abbott ran a single off the first ball of the final over, Morris struck successive full tosses from Topley for four and six. However, a dot ball was followed by two to long-off, leaving Morris on strike for the last delivery of the game. Had Topley completed the run-out, the game would have gone to a super over. Alex Hales helped get England off to a promising start with the bat but became Tahir's first wicket when he was caught for 27, Duminy taking a high catch despite team-mate Kagiso Rabada almost rugby-tackling him in a race for the ball. Three balls later Root fell for eight to Wiese's first delivery and Stokes was stumped off Tahir the ball after hitting a muscular six. "We tried to learn from their mistakes - maybe they went a bit hard at the ball - and we tried to play deeper. 
Labour said the government was not listening to criticism of how payments are assessed. Disability rights campaigners said the changes were one of a number of cuts and changes faced by disabled people and those in ill health. In a written statement to the House of Commons on Thursday, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work Penny Mordaunt said the government monitored how effective the payment was in supporting those facing the greatest barriers to leading independent lives. A Lib Dem work and pensions spokeswoman said it was "utterly outrageous" the government was using the ruling to "make matters worse" for disabled people. Philip Connolly from Disability Rights UK said the changes showed "escalating levels of unfairness" in the government's approach to a benefit it had created.

Pre-tax profits fell to £78.7m in the first six months of the year, down 35% from £121.8m a year earlier. Referring to William Hill's purchase of the stake in NeoGames, Mr Henderson described the online lottery market as an "exciting opportunity". 
"If they're at the top of the league and going to win something, then I hope we can keep it up and they can keep comparing us to them." "From Monday to Sunday it's fun all the way, the coaching staff make sure we're working hard and putting everything into it. "But at the same time we're enjoying it, not just because we're winning, but the way we're playing is a good style and brand of footy." 
Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said. "I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef," Prof Hughes said. Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said. The Australian Department of Environment previously said that state and federal governments were investing a projected A$2bn over the next decade to protect the reef.

During the attack, seven blasts ripped through trains in the evening rush hour. Pakistan had rejected the allegations and said India had given no evidence of Pakistani involvement in the attacks. Mumbai's suburban train system is one of the busiest in the world, carrying more than eight million commuters a day. 
Cancer Research UK is calling on the Scottish government to act to make it easier to shop healthily and improve the diets of Scots. It wants restrictions on supermarket multi-buy discounts on foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt to form part of measures in the expected Scottish government strategy to improve diets. The charity said half (52%) of adults in Scotland had a ready meal once a week or more and 16% eat fast food or a takeaway at least once a week. Its head of nutrition science and policy, Heather Peace, said: "We all need to recognise there is a problem and everyone, including consumers, the food and drink industry, retailers, media and government has a part to play in finding a solution." 
The family has been raising money for her medical bills and several Wisconsin businesses have come forward to host fundraisers. "The compassion and love expressed to our family by the people of Wisconsin [and from people around the world] has greatly assisted our family in this healing process," the family said in a statement. The victim was found by a cyclist after crawling from the woods with stab wounds to her arms, legs and torso. 
A UK Athletics-licensed coach, Skafidas ran a training group for young athletes in Lincolnshire, but Ukad confirmed the nine violations all related to his conduct with Wilson. 
"We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh. The first minister added: "There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that." 
"Seeing the video, you can tell that it was done on purpose," she said.

A number of options are being considered to improve care in the north of the county, including removing consultant-led services from Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital. They have warned mothers and babies "may die" if consultant-led maternity services are removed from Whitehaven and concentrated at Carlisle Cumberland Infirmary. 
If you are playing for Rangers, you have to go and beat your rivals and Celtic will say the same. Celtic, who have already won the Premiership title and the League Cup, are 33 points clear of Rangers in the league. "Celtic have won the league comfortably and deservedly so. I like the way they have changed and the more direct approach suits the players better, they seem to be getting the results. 
There were a number of disturbances in the area over the St Patrick's Day holiday in 2016. "I call on the supermarkets to match the actions of the local off-sales and stop deliveries of alcohol into the Holylands area on St Patrick's Day and the day before." "It's drink that's the problem, and the fuelling of drink." 
The man is described as 50-60 years of age, 5ft 9ins (1.75m) to 6ft (1.82m) tall with black hair that is greying. 
An Army spokesman said the unit would "play a key part in enabling the UK to fight in the information age" and that it "consists of more than just traditional capabilities". "It recognises that the actions of others in a modern battlefield can be affected in ways that are not necessarily violent and it draws heavily on important lessons from our commitments to operations in Afghanistan amongst others." He acknowledged the need for this type of innovation, but said "it should be added to the forces, not created out of savings found elsewhere." The Army spokesman said it would share the "spirit of innovation" of the Chindits in the Burma Campaign of 1942 to 1945. He said: "Sadly the Ministry of Defence didn't inform the surviving Chindit veterans of the decision to use the badge in this way. It can be seen as proof that the Army is adapting to modern asymmetric warfare, and that it remains relevant at a time when there are fears within the British military of more cuts after the election. He added: "In some senses it's defensive - trying to present the case from this side against opponents who hold many of the cards. 
Christopher Williams, 25, who was living in Derby, died at the scene of the crash on the A52, in Bottesford, on 25 May 2016. 
After the stabbing, Ms Sands went to the Isle of Dogs, putting the knife and clothes she had been wearing in a carrier bag. During a police interview, she said she had tried to help him, while all the while he was abusing young children. She later said in a statement that she denied intending to kill Mr Pleasted or cause him serious bodily harm, claiming she went to confront him and took a knife for protection as she was scared. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International released a report criticising conditions at a detention centre on the island of Nauru. "There was no consultation with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection from Amnesty International in preparation of this report," the statement said. "We strongly refute many of the allegations in the report and would encourage Amnesty International to contact the Department before airing allegations of this kind." 
"Wherever you go across Wales people raise the issue of the NHS, and Labour are running the NHS in Wales," he said. "(Labour leader) Ed Miliband has used the example of 'compare and contrast', and I think it is perfectly reasonable to point out we don't have a cancer drugs fund here in Wales and some of the most disappointing ambulance response times on record," he said. Party leader Leanne Wood said: "Every community has a stake in making our country a success and it is time the north of Wales got the investment and vision it deserves from governments in Cardiff and London." 
"It's certainly the highest price ever achieved for a beach hut in Abersoch," remarked Tony Webber, auction surveyor at Beresford Adams Countrywide Auctions.

The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making "significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable". 
The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling "breakdowns in the Siresp network" and for "lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through". The civil protection authority has already confirmed "failures in the Siresp network" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network. The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later. 
However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date. Fifa's reform committee also made a number of recommendations for the governing body to make changes to "improve efficiency, prevent fraud and conflicts of interest and increase transparency in the organisation". 
The first such system in Ireland has been introduced in response to the large number of collisions between road vehicles and trams at the junction. 
Wednesday's clash between Sunderland and Manchester City at the Stadium of Light saw a figure dressed as the superhero walk among the players. 
She met British veterans who liberated the camp, and heard stories of the "horrific" scenes that greeted them. The 89-year-old Queen and her husband, who's 94, walked quite a distance through what remains of the camp, and met a few of those who lived and three of the British soldiers who set them free. The survivors and the liberators told them about their shared experience of horror. The Queen, who is patron of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, had not visited a concentration camp before and it is believed she requested the trip. She was taken on a tour of the site - which was razed to the ground and is now a museum and memorial to those who died - with the minimum of protocol. The Queen also visited a memorial to Anne Frank and her sister Margot. The visit to the former concentration camp was the Queen's final engagement before returning to the UK.

"I'm not going to speak any more (about) the incident, it's a major one in the game but I don't have to explain my feelings, and you can guess Jordan's feelings," he added. "But I'm not sure it was the only incident that turned the game. 
They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said. Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs. But Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality. 
A spokesman for the club insisted: "We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage." The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over. However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices. 
The work is due to be carried out mainly at night until February 2018, with the M4 scheduled to be closed between junctions 25A for Caerleon and Cwmbran and 26 at Malpas up to five nights a week. 
Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be "unprecedented", it is not a new phenomenon. "Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas," he said. "The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of," said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore. 
Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika. After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds. Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward. WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: "The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs.

Ethnically the former Soviet republic is as diverse, with the Kazakhs making up nearly two thirds of the population, ethnic Russians just under a quarter, and smaller minorities the rest. Since independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, major investment in the oil sector has brought rapid economic growth, and eased some of the start disparities in wealth of the 1990s. Born in 1940, Mr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and was elected president the following year. He was re-elected after the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, and since then another four times - practically unopposed - most recently in 2015. Mr Nazarbayev has concentrated extensive powers in his own hands and is accused by the opposition of suppressing dissent. Opposition media outlets faced unprecedented legal pressure in late 2012, seen as linked to their coverage of the deadly 2011 clashes between police and striking oil workers in the city of Zhanaozen. 
In athletics, Kyron Duke finished fifth overall in the final of the F41 shot put and Olivia Breen qualified for the final of the T38 100m after finishing fourth in her heat. On the track, Jordan Howe is an outside medal chance in the T35 100m and begins his bid in the heats.

But she has now said she would meet with "people who genuinely love the Irish language and don't want to use it as a political weapon". Mr Ó Muilleoir said he hoped she would listen carefully to the views of Irish speakers as they are "united and firm on the need for an Irish Language Act". "I think that Arlene will find when she meets the Irish language community that they're a very broad church, people with all political views and none," he said. 
"It was in March that I noticed that the travel back for the international games was proving more difficult than I thought it was going to be." In June, he was back in Scotland for the friendly against Qatar and a few days later played a key role in Scotland's 1-1 draw in the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. "I didn't want to give the national manager any excuse whenever I met up with the national team, travelling back from Chicago." "Let's hope that we're good enough to get the results needed to get us out the group and get us to a major championship." 
"I haven't had the most straightforward of competitions with a few falls on Friday and Saturday. 
The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened. Mr Lickley said it was a "tragedy" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. He said: "Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time," before the yacht left the UK in October 2013. 
"Of course there's a bit of frustration I didn't play much at Atletico," said Borja, who scored 18 goals last season in La Liga for Eibar. Despite competition from La Liga and Premier League sides for the Spaniard's signature, Borja says his decision to join Swansea was not difficult. "It's a great club who have a lot of confidence in their players and I really want to make a good impression here." 
But the West Midlands team have come a long way since their formation in 1991 and can make history on Saturday by reaching the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. It will not be easy against the relative giants of FC United of Manchester but, whatever happens at the Aspray Arena, it will be another chapter in a remarkable story. Sporting Khalsa are fifth in the Midland League Premier Division, the ninth tier of the English football pyramid. "Preparations started on Sunday because we had to clear an access route for vans to bring in the marquees we are having to use because our bar is not big enough," said Inder Grewa, one of Sporting Khalsa's 12 owners, who also acts as treasurer. Prior to this FA Cup run, Sporting Khalsa had never had an attendance in three figures, but there were 750 at the Aspray Arena for the visit of Spalding in the third qualifying round. Normal home match plans have had to be altered at a club where stadium and bar manager Bal Gacha is the only full-time member of staff. "But we have not been able to do that this weekend because instead of 20 we have had to get a thousand done. "We have brought the marquees in because we simply could not accommodate the numbers we are expecting in the bar. Three promotions have taken them to the upper echelons of the Midland League. "There is a group of 12 who you could say are the core of the club," said Grewa. We are a community club - and the community is everybody." "We want to get to the National League," said Grewa. "Up to the National League, we could still do our jobs and handle it." By any logic, Sporting Khalsa do not stand a chance of bridging the gap to FC United, akin to a League Two side taking on a Premier League team. The chance of us reaching the level we will need to win this game is probably one in a hundred. 
Officers were called to Bury Old Road in Greater Manchester, home to a large Orthodox Jewish community, who were celebrating Rosh Hashanah on Monday. 
In her resignation letter to Scottish Labour chairman Jamie Glackin Ms Lamont said the referendum had "opened a new chapter in the debate about the future of the Scottish Labour Party". Ms Sturgeon said: "The scale of the infighting between Scottish Labour and Labour at Westminster is exposed for all to see." In the meantime, deputy leader Anas Sarwar is in charge and an MSP will be chosen to stand in for Ms Lamont at Holyrood. She took over as the party's Scottish leader in the aftermath of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, when Labour suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the SNP. In the weeks after the independence referendum, she said she wanted to lead Labour to victory in the next Holyrood election in 2016 and become first minister. Labour leader Ed Miliband said she deserved "significant credit" for the successful "No" vote in the Scottish referendum campaign. Senior Labour sources have indicated that both the former Prime minister, Gordon Brown and the former Scottish Secretary , Jim Murphy, will be approached to see if they are willing to lead the Labour Party in Scotland. 
In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company. 2001, l'Odyssee de l'espace is the French title of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.

His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a "deposit" in exchange for employment and a salary. Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him. In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed. 
David Testa, chief executive of London Paramount, said: "In light of our ongoing studies and detailed discussions with the Planning Inspectorate‎ and local authorities, we have decided to give ourselves a bit more time to....revise our submission date for the development consent order." 
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said late last month that close to a quarter of those killed were under the age of 18. Mr Valls said his government "respects Russia and Russia's interests" but "that to re-discover the path to peace, to discussion, the Russian bombing of civilians has to stop". Agreement to try to bring about a cessation of hostilities and allow more access for humanitarian aid was reached by world powers late on Thursday in Germany, but neither the Syrian government nor the rebels were involved. The tentative deal reached here in Munich to pause the fighting in Syria was always going to be a tough sell to the warring parties on the ground. For much of the day the Russian and Western ministers have been trading accusations and counter-accusations as to who is to blame for the ongoing misery that is the Syrian civil war. Rebel groups in Syria have told the BBC they would not stop fighting because they do not believe that Russia will end its bombing campaign in support of the government. In another sign of the complexity of the conflict, reports said that on Saturday Turkish forces had shelled Kurdish militia targets in Aleppo provinces. On Saturday, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Saudi Arabia would send war planes to the Turkish air base of Incirlik, from where they would attack militants in Syria from the so-called Islamic State. Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, five years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, Islamic State, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. 
However, he added that should an adjournment of the court hearing provide a more stable course and future for the club, then they would favour an adjournment. Loft also want to meet Hearn, still the chairman of World Snooker, to discuss its plans for saving the club. "I have been a bit critical of fans' trusts in the past up and down the country. It comes down to what plan they have in their mind, what is the sustainability of the club within that plan and what management, because it is all about management." "I kept the ground to make sure it wasn't used for the wrong reasons - that it wasn't the wrong reasons for buying a football club. 
I'm not trying to sell records, I'm not trying to get on the radio, I'm honestly just trying to make a record that excites me and that I think is interesting. I did have people in mind but, in the interest of avoiding public feuds, I can't even begin to name names because in the course of my life, whenever I've criticised a fellow musician, it has ended up being something that I have truly regretted. But your album Play was the first album to have every track licensed to advertisers - if a corporation came to you now and asked to use Don't Leave Me from the new album - what would you do? I have a feeling that on my death bed the last question someone asks me before I die will be about licensing music to advertisements. At this point, most of what I do and I hesitate to say this because it does sound a little self-aggrandising but it's sincere, is that most of the work I do now is non-profit. I was raised by very active hippies with an idea that whatever you do, in so far as you can, you should try and make the world a better place. Again, I can't be so presumptuous to say I am making it a better place but at least I want to try. I made a record about two years ago that was very choral and so I used the name The Void Pacific Choir, which is a DH Lawrence quote because I liked it, but I scrapped the album and then started work on this one but I kept the name. But the truth is that it's me on my own so if I go back and record something under my name, it all seems kind of arbitrary to me. Most musicians put out a record with the intent of touring and my intention is to never tour again as long as I live because I hate touring. 
"On the one hand you'll find that students are significantly more likely to get into university with the Welsh Baccalaureate. "Although we find significant results, it does appear that students without the Welsh Baccalaureate are more likely to get a first or a 2:1." It could be more tailored to the particular needs of the students in terms of their choice of subjects at university they're going to study. A spokesperson added: "Our independent review of qualifications addressed many of the findings in the WISERD report, and we are already taking action to deliver the review's recommendations regarding the Welsh Baccalaureate. 
He over-hit his fourth and two putted from the back edge for a six. Woods then pulled his drive on the par-four 18th into a lake and although he hit the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for the fourth six of his round. And although he cancelled out his bogey on the 11th with a birdie on the 15th, his two late double bogeys blotted an otherwise encouraging round.

The filing of the challenge was confirmed by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesman for Austria's constitutional court. Is Europe lurching to the far right? But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court. But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election. 
The report suggested splitting the current role, as both head of the legal system and president of the States. Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: "The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world. 
The rebels launched simultaneous attacks on western districts of the city controlled by government forces, firing hundreds of rockets and shells, the Syrian Observatory reported. The military responded with a heavy aerial and artillery bombardment of rebel positions in the city, and the fighting continued for several hours. The Syrian Observatory said the rebels had managed to seize some buildings in the north-western outskirts of Aleppo, but that the gains were not of strategic importance. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says that if the rebels do manage to capture all Aleppo, it would be a huge blow to the government. There have been persistent reports in recent weeks that it is preparing to give up both the northern city, and Deraa in the south, the better to defend the core areas of western Syria with the limited manpower at its disposal, he adds.

The official ONA news agency said they were flown on Wednesday out of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthi rebel movement. "The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying," the official said by telephone from Sanaa. 
The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now. The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine. Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced. The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. 
The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment It was his second victory of the year, to follow on from a win in China last month, and he finished second to Raikkonen in Australia, the only other race in which he has not had problems. "So what we need to do is have consistent podium results for the next four or five races and that will bring us a lot of points to put in the pocket." "The supporters will have a smile for one afternoon, one night, and it is not the easiest time for the country at the moment, so I'm happy for them and thanks to them for the support." Raikkonen finished runner-up to Alonso, his third second place in a row, and said: "We are here to try to win races and championships. "We still finished fourth and got some good points, we wanted more but we just didn't have the tyres to fight with the guys in front.

It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates. The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council. 
Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job. But the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues. And what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens? In this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all? 
The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment. In its March report, the CQC described a "disconnect between the trust board and it's staff" and a "culture where staff were afraid to speak out". A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures. 
Unveiling the pledge - an extension of the Help to Buy mortgage scheme - Mr Cameron said the Conservatives wanted more young people to "achieve the dream" of owning their own home. "There's a real concern that removing the requirement on developers to build affordable housing means this policy may not help those facing the greatest struggle to get a home of their own," he said. Savings from using such land would be passed on to the buyers, the Conservatives said. The homes would be exempt "from a raft of taxes", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development. Some building regulations - including the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units. 
Then it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will: In the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. And that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. And there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers. There will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. There will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry. Then MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading. In the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. There will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee). And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. In the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on "pay to stay" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above). There will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. 
Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays. Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school. 
Henry, who has won eight caps for Ireland as well as playing 109 times for Ulster, is hoping to win a trophy with the province after defeats in the Heineken Cup final and Pro12 final in the past two seasons. "It would be hard to find anyone who is more passionate about playing for Ulster than Chris Henry and I am extremely pleased he will be part of the squad until at least 2017." 
Northern Ireland's McIlroy, twice a winner in seven US PGA starts, bogeyed the last for a one-under 69 to finish three over and miss the cut by one. With the cut mark hovering between one and two over par, McIlroy, who holed a 30-foot putt on the 17th to get to two over, thought he needed another birdie on the last. He dropped to one under par after three-putt bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes but a three-foot eagle putt on the par-five 18th, his ninth, followed by three birdies on the front nine, moved him one clear of the field. "I got off to a bit of a wobbly start and stood over a six-foot putt on the 14th to avoid going three over, so I'm quite happy that went in and I turned it on from 18," said the 40-year-old, who won his first major at Royal Troon two weeks ago. Walker, 37, made a solid start to round two with two birdies and seven pars in his opening nine holes before moving clear of the field with a run of three successive birdies from the 12th. Streb started on the 10th and had four birdies and a bogey in his opening nine holes and closed with three in four holes to become the 30th player to card a 63 in a major - no player has ever shot a 62. "It was a bit of a mess but to come back and birdie eight and nine made things a lot better for me on the back nine." "It was a really solid round and I'm back in contention," said the American. Kaymer, who started at four under, began the front and back nines with bogeys but three birdies in his last four holes lifted him to five under. He dropped back to level with bogeys on the fifth and seventh holes, but he then birdied the eighth. Andy Sullivan, who reached five under, dropped away with six bogeys in nine holes through the middle of his round before finishing birdie-eagle on the two par-five finishing holes to post a 71 and a two-under total that matched Paul Casey (69).

It will include plans to stop some British citizens returning to the UK, and others from leaving the country. Mr Anderson - appointed by the government to be its independent reviewer of terrorism legislation - said the new anti-terror legislation was "nothing like as dramatic" as David Cameron had proposed earlier this year. "The concern I have about this power and the central concern about it is: where are the courts in all of this? "If the home secretary wants to impose a TPIM she has to go to the court first and if the court says she's got it wrong, it will say so. "One will want to look very carefully to see if this is a power that requires the intervention of the court at any stage, or whether it's simply envisaged as something the home secretary imposes. Speaking ahead of the bill's publication, Mrs May said: "We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. "This bill includes a considered, targeted set of proposals that will help to keep us safe at a time of very significant danger by ensuring we have the powers we need to defend ourselves." The Home Office says communications data has played a major role in "every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade" but gaps in the UK's access to such information need to be filled. Technology firms said there had been insufficient consultation on the more limited proposals in the bill requiring firms to keep information to help the authorities to match internet protocol (IP) addresses to an individual user or a device. The Home Office said it had met internet service providers and other groups to discuss the measures but the Internet Services Providers Association said there had been "a distinct lack of engagement" with the industry. 
Those gathered here believe that Mr Kumar, the leader of the university's student union, is innocent of the sedition charges levelled against him, and are shocked by the fact that police entered the university to arrest him on Saturday. The students here passionately defend Mr Kumar when I ask them what actually happened at the event. "Right-wing students want to increase their foothold in the university and that is why they got him [Mr Kumar] arrested. They feel bolstered because the right-wing BJP party is in power at the centre," she says. At one of the student housing facilities, I meet PhD students Bibas Sewa and Bijay Thapa. The two condemn the arrest of Mr Kumar, but agree that the protests have disrupted their studies.

Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place. 
He said that following the first admission he discovered a DNR order had been placed on his medical file. He told the BBC that at no time did either he or his sister grant permission for a DNR notice to be placed on his file. While he survived the first bout of pneumonia, he said he discovered when admitted for a second time that the DNR notice had not been removed. In a letter to Mr Birnie dated October 2015 and seen by the BBC, the trust explained that as he was so unwell they had spoken to his sister. However, Mr Birnie said he does not accept that a DNR notice was placed on his file in advance of him being admitted without his or his sister's consent. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for the Northern Health Trust confirmed that a DNR notice was placed on Mr Birnie's file in January 2014, but not before a conversation had taken place with their patient.

And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air," she said. But a spokesman for the RSPCA said: "In principle we would not have an issue with police forces training eagles in an attempt to tackle drones, although we would have concerns over the welfare of the birds. A Met Police spokesman said: "As would be expected in an organisation that is transforming, we take an interest in all innovative new ideas and will of course be looking at the work of the Dutch police use of eagles." 
"It's the realisation of what started off as an interesting idea and now we've got 70 trestles with thousands of oysters on them all waiting to be eaten in the restaurants." David Salter, from the Community Interest Company, said they "haven't got the fastest growing site in the South West" but are hoping to sell around 30,000 oysters this year. 
As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation. In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces. Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side. The best players in Wales are playing on the field, it's as simple as that really."

After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was "just about the right length of time" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done. After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: "I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length. Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: "It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves. He is going to be in the public glare for a long time to come and he knows that." 
In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants arrived in the province of Quebec seeking asylum. Canadian diplomatic staff in the US  have been trying to "aggressively dispel the myths" about coming to Canada circulating south of the border, including that residency is guaranteed, said Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen. Canadian officials are also trying to counteract the spread of misinformation online about the openness of Canada's asylum system. In the first half of August, 3,800 migrants crossed seeking asylum in the province. The federal government has increased the number of staff in the region in order to help process claims that determine whether a migrant is eligible to make a refugee claim. 
Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training. "In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country." "And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents." 
The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate. Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions. The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child. I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. The announcement in China came on the final day of a summit of the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, known as the fifth plenum. 
The Eiffel Tower in Paris is expected to be lit up in green light on Friday to mark the entry into force of the historic climate pact. The deal agreed in the French capital less than a year ago commits governments to moving their economies away from fossil fuels. On Thursday, a UN review of national pledges to cut carbon said they fall short of the levels needed to keep the rise in global temperatures under 2C. Paris is the first agreement tying rich and poor nations in a common endeavour to protect the climate. The process of the Paris deal is binding, including a commitment for governments to keep returning to the issue to ratchet up the clean energy targets that they all agree are inadequate. Donald Trump has called manmade climate change "a hoax" and said he would "cancel" the Paris Agreement and other international efforts to address the issue. Hillary Clinton backs the Paris deal, saying climate change is a threat to American security.

He said the crowd had reached the Washington monument as he spoke at the US Capitol, despite photographic evidence to the contrary. On Saturday, millions in the US and around the world protested against Mr Trump's new administration. Mr Spicer, who did not take questions, added: "There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable, and I'm here to tell you it goes two ways. Mr Trump said the media had invented a feud between them, although in a recent row over a leaked dossier that alleged the Kremlin held compromising material on him, he had likened the actions of intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany. Mr Trump's election has divided opinion in the US and around the world. 
Aside from the odd soldier dug in by the side of the road and the vigilance of Ukraine's border guards, there is little to suggest that the country is preparing for Russian military action from the south. The war of words between Russia and Ukraine has intensified following Moscow's accusation that Kiev plotted a sabotage attack in Crimea. And pictures of the Russian navy carrying out military drills in Crimea to counter the threat of saboteurs were quickly beamed around the world. This week Russia is carrying out more exercises in Crimea to counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction. However little, if anything, has changed at the checkpoints in and out of Crimea. Tamara's mother-in-law and daughter were going to join her on the trip to Crimea, but because of what they had seen on the news they decided to stay in Kiev. Across the water from Crimea in the small town of Skadovsk, the melee of swimsuits and food-sellers on the beach is proof that many Ukrainians will simply not travel to Russian-annexed Crimea as a point of principle. 
E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower. British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut. It said customers on so-called "fix and fall" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction. Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: "Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs."

In a Commons debate, the ex-Labour leader said Conservative plans to limit the voting powers of Scottish MPs on Commons laws would "rip up" hundreds of years of parliamentary procedure. At the end of the debate, Labour staged and won a vote in which the government abstained. And Conservative MP David Davis raised a point of order to urge the government to allow more time for the matter to be considered. "To go as far as the government wants to go in the timescale they want to go brings with it an attendant level of risk that I would consider to be irresponsible," he said. Pressed by Mr Miliband on "what the meaning and definition" of English-only legislation would be, Mr Grayling said it would be up to the Speaker to decide but he believed a "simple test" would be what things were devolved to Scotland. The SNP said Scottish voters would be affected by legislation on schools and NHS budgets in England through the Barnett Formula used to allocate public spending to different nations of the UK. Responding to a question by an SNP MP on Monday, Mr Grayling said the only English-only measure during the last Parliament had been the Education Bill, and there were 13 Bills which applied to England and Wales. 
Prior to Thursday's by-election he had been deputy mayor of the borough. 
They have been given the scientific name of Hoolock tianxing - but their common name is now the Skywalker hoolock gibbon, thanks to the scientists' taste in films. Dr Turvey said the team had been studying the animals in the Gaoligongshan nature reserve, but it was not easy. "Then you have to wake up really early in the morning and you listen out for the haunting song of the gibbons, which carries in the forest canopy. The researchers estimate that there are about 200 of the Skywalker gibbons living in China - and also some living in neighbouring Myanmar, although the population size there is currently unknown. 
Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: "It has been another amazing season for the Leeds Rhinos and [the event] is an opportunity for supporters to congratulate the team on their efforts and also say a big thank you to legends Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock and Kylie Leuluai." "We are extremely proud as a city of the Rhinos, whose commitment, dedication and achievements on the field - coupled with the work they do in our communities - is simply fantastic. 
RSPCA Inspector Helen Smith said it was not clear if the dog was alive when it was thrown in the canal. 
Mr Baird says the laws are reducing assaults, and that a number of small bars have opened since the laws were introduced. Owner Dave Evans said the laws caused a 60% drop in trade, forcing him to close his doors and put 170 staff out of work. Mr Barrie passionately denounced the impact of the laws and pushed a philosophy of personal responsibility that touched a nerve with many Sydneysiders. Reaction to Mr Barrie's piece prompted Mr Baird, a conservative and Christian, to respond on social media, where he had previous success live-tweeting amusing responses to the finale of reality television show The Bachelor. "Sydney has a rich history of the inner city pub which you are destroying," said another. Popular Australian DJ and musician Alison Wonderland was one of the many who responded to Mr Baird. The lockout laws are almost two years old now and due to be subjected to a detailed review.

He insisted there was "everything still to play for" in the contest and would not rule out standing again if Mr Corbyn won. "If Jeremy is deluding himself that we are heading to victory I do not think the rest of the party or the country can afford to be deluded about where we are," he said, claiming Labour was "in the doldrums" and that it faced "Groundhog Day" if Mr Corbyn won. A spokesman for Mr Corbyn's campaign said: "You can tell things are going from bad to worse for Owen Smith's desperate campaign as he turns his vitriol on Labour members instead of the Tory government. 
Tomasz Procko, 22, and Karol Szymanski, 29, had been delivering sofas to the Knightsbridge property on Friday morning when the balcony collapsed.

Regardless of the horse race that sprung from Lord Derby calling it right and winning that toss at Epsom in 1779, defeat would have had a much wider significance. The event and its name are believed to be the root of the expression 'derby match', and it's worth considering that the loser was Sir Charles Bunbury. "It's a unique track," he says, staring out over the course as it snakes its way up, down and around the Surrey Downs barely 15 miles south west of central London. "It is a proper test of a horse - you wouldn't necessarily design it as a track for anything other than a rigorous test of a three-year-old in the first week of June, and that's what it is." It's 20 years since he saddled Benny The Dip to win, and two since he masterminded Golden Horn's big-race success with Frankie Dettori riding in the silks of owner-breeder Anthony Oppenheimer. Cracksman represents the same owner-trainer-jockey combination, and comes to Epsom with two wins from two starts, the second at Epsom when narrowly beating fellow Derby hopeful - and this year's Dante winner - Permian. However, the presence of Diore Lia, the large field and the chance for Frankel to father a first European Classic winner gives the whole thing an intriguing narrative. 
A police spokesman said: "While we ask people to be vigilant, we will take robust action against anyone who causes significant disruption through hoax activity."

The internet video-calling business - which is owned by Microsoft - said it was initially looking to take on staff in London and Stockholm. A recent study by the analytics company Comscore suggested that Yahoo's share of online search queries in the USfell below 14% for the first time in February, putting it further behind Google and Microsoft. It says the move would increase its headcount in the city by 40% to 330 posts. Skype's move signals that it is not overly concerned about the UK government's intention to give the country's security services increased access to internet data. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has specifically identified Skype as one of the services that the government wants to be monitored. A statement from Skype said that: "We are not in a position to comment on the UK government's proposed legislation. 
Labour's Lindsay Hoyle topped the ballot and was re-elected as chairman of ways and means. Deputy speakers, who stand in for Mr Bercow in the main Commons chamber and have a range of other duties, were elected for the first time in 2010. 
As part of its review of the spy agencies' activities, the IPT examined the organisations' collection of communications data - involving the "who, where, when, how and with whom" was involved in conversations, but not their contents - and personal information about people. Article 8 of the ECHR states, however, that all citizens have the right to a private life and that any interference with personal data must be lawful and necessary. It added that the government was "committed" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies. 
Two fighters from the Free Syrian Army were also killed and another two injured in the attack. "Two of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh (IS) elements," the army statement said. 
Monuments to Confederate figures are symbols of "modern white supremacy and neo-Nazism", the college said. "Last week, the horrific displays of hatred at the University of Virginia and in Charlottesville shocked and saddened the nation," University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves said on Sunday. "The University of Texas at Austin has a duty to preserve and study history," Mr Fenves continued. It follows violent clashes at a march on 12 August in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists and neo-Nazis protested against the removal of a monument of General Lee.

"He's developed very well and met the challenge to play for a big club, feel pressure and win trophies," he said. "He wants to improve and that's the type of player you want to work with." "There's no doubt there will be a natural point in time that he goes, I think we all understand that. But if he serves the club well in his time here that's all we can ask for."

"At the end of the day, there was a plan, there was sledging, and short-pitched balls were bowled at Phillip Hughes, which increased the risk of an injury," Mr Melick said. Hughes' brother and sister later exited the inquest as the sworn statements from the players were defended. The counsel assisting the coroner, Kristina Stern SC, said concerns about sledging and short balls were "unnecessary" and should not form part of the findings. 
This is the first group to be released since about 125 children were abducted in the cross-border raid. However, the scale of the 15 April shocked many people in both countries, and led to protests in Ethiopia's Gambella region with parents demanding greater protection for their children. 
"Yes, my dad is Indian and I'm proud of it, I'm proud that I have Indian in me. "I know a lot of people who are haafu and suffer," she said. Now, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to "get over it". One Twitter user said she won because she "must have deserved it" while another said "after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan". In Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the "lack of purity". Ms Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her.

Bristol-born Kersey-Brown grew up in Penmaenmawr and was a Wales schoolboy rugby union international. 
Labour backed the campaign to keep the UK in the EU in the referendum in June and many Labour MPs represent constituencies which voted for Remain. His shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has said that, since a UK-wide referendum with a 72% turnout returned a vote in favour of withdrawing from the EU, it would "be very undermining of democracy" for MPs to vote against beginning the formal process of leaving. The bill is due to be debated by MPs on Tuesday - in a sitting that may last until midnight - and clear the Commons on 8 February, after which it will move to the House of Lords.

President Joko Widodo proposed the changes in May following the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl. Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: "Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. She said: "Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. 
The teenager had been taking part in a type of bungee jump known as "puenting", which involves diving with two cords attached, and then swinging beneath the bridge or viaduct. Prior to the two fatalities this summer, the most recent was that of a 48-year-old man at Robledo de Chavela, near Madrid, in 2013. The jump took place from the top of a bridge over the A8 road at Cabezon de la Sal in Cantabria. 
As was the fashion in the late 18th Century, a new walled garden was then built out of sight from the house. The garden was abandoned in 1782 and the walls were demolished by Robert Adam's workmen as part of a wide range of improvements carried out around the castle. 
According to UN Aids, which has a report out today, the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new HIV infections and nearly eight million Aids-related deaths since the millennium. A major gap seems to be in awareness of HIV status, which is the biggest barrier to treatment access, says the report. The report says the next five years will be critical and recommends front-loading investment to "sprint" towards an ambition of ending the Aids epidemic by 2030. 
Now he is able to live his life as normal and now he will be carrying the Olympic torch in Rhos-on-Sea when it travels through Wales from 25-30 May. "It's quite an amazing privilege because the guy who nominated me I met in Beijing at the Paralympic Games.

Official figures showed the value of sales rose by 0.1% north of the border between January and March, compared with 0.3% for the UK. The Scottish Retail Sales Index also showed that the volume of sales in Scotland went up by 2.7% over the year, while the value rose by just 0.1%. Mr Lonsdale said: "The prospects for retailers are ultimately determined by the state of the economy and their own ability to adapt and seize on the opportunities that arise.

In a statement his family said he was a "very competent skier and snowboarder". It said: "The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead. He said: "He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. The family have a farm in the small village of Talybont-on-Usk in the Brecon Beacons, where Carwyn's parents Ceri and Rhys run an award-winning produce business and rent holiday cottages.

The jury returned a conclusion of suicide but found the care plan when Ms McManus was discharged was inadequate and there was not enough communication with the family about her suicide risk. During the inquest, the hospital said her anorexia was one of the most severe cases it had seen. The coroner, Andrew Bridgman, said he will write to all of the agencies involved in her care. The inquest heard Ms McManus had a history of self-harming and had previously written a number of goodbye notes to her family, doctor, and The Priory hospital. Deborah Coles, director of INQUEST, a charity that supported the family during the court process, said her parents' "concerns were dismissed and minimised throughout".

The teenagers were part of a gang known as the Lane Heads, a rival gang to the Walton Village Heads which Mr McHugh was linked to. Months earlier, Dykstra was stabbed in the chest by a member of the Walton Village Heads and wanted to "avenge that stabbing", the court heard. Armed with knives and the makeshift sword stick, described as similar to a broom handle but with a blade attached, the gang forced the back door to the room where Mr McHugh was hiding. 
In cross examination, Ms Short agreed it was possible the defendant's DNA could have been transferred on to the gloves without him having worn them.

Typhoon Phanfone was downgraded from an earlier status of a super typhoon, but the Japan Meteorological Agency had warned it was still a dangerous storm. The storm was expected to deposit about 100mm of rain on Tokyo over 24 hours, according to the Transport Ministry website. Many schools were closed on Monday and two car companies in Japan halted production at some plants ahead of the storm. 
Aberdeen Coastguard, which co-ordinated the operation, said it was alerted at 11:30 on Sunday. 
If anything, it was reaction of the Hull KR players and their families that made the biggest impression on Kopczak. "It's not a nice position to be in and I wouldn't recommend it. Hull KR's Ben Cockayne described the concept as "a disgrace" and said it hurt the Rugby Football League's efforts to promote good mental health. "But the boys are really up for it and we want to build on the success of last year." "It's for us to lead from the front and get ourselves in a great position to start with and kick on from there," Kopczak said. 
"Hopefully I will get much more game time now and I think that is going to be really important for me in my international career as well." "It made it really appealing to me, and was one of the big reasons why I signed there. Stoke City, bottom of the table after two defeats and a draw in their opening three games of the Premier League season, host Tottenham on Saturday. "There was pressure on us to get off to a winning start and get those three points which was important for us," added Allen. "But to do it with four goals and in relative comfort in the end is just what we wanted. 
And, on a drive between the Republican Convention in Cleveland, Ohio and the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia, I gained an insight into another factor adding to the unpredictability - the growing numbers of Americans who are switching, or thinking of switching, party allegiances. Tim - who didn't want to give his last name - is a lawyer who works in Cleveland's Key Tower, the tallest building between Chicago and Philadelphia. That's very dangerous for the country and I love my country more than I love my party." So, is Mr Trump the man to do that? She says that she enjoyed Mr Trump's speech at the Republican convention. "I like that it was a doom and gloom speech that didn't sugar coat what's going down in our country. She has been an active Republican Party member for 30 years and was a delegate to the 2012 convention in Tampa. But the Trump takeover has led her to take a big decision - she's just cancelled her party membership. But, despite that assessment, Ann can't bring herself to vote for the Republican Party's bogeywoman, Mrs Clinton, in November. And that represents one of the challenges for the Democratic Party. But to really succeed it needs to address and counter the negative impression that many Americans have of her. 
Ms Kelbie told Dundee Sheriff Court during a brief trial that she had not been in a state of "fear or alarm" when Mr Kenneth was at her door. 
A spokesman for Newcastle University said: "The INTO building is now open for staff and students following last night's evacuation and we are working closely with Northumbria Police with their on-going inquiries."

It is an "entirely original" piece of work, with "Dickensian sweep and momentum to the storytelling", writes Shenton, adding: "It earns its place on the stage, feeling distinct from both the books and the screen adaptations. In a nod to the Kings Cross platform number, Ann Treneman gives the play four and three-quarters stars in The Times, saying the "wizardry on display" is "out of this world". She says the plot is complex ("there are mazes that are more straightforward") but adds: "It's a raunchless Game of Thrones with heart. "It's not the movie of the book. Shepherd adds: "It's quite apparent this isn't written to be either a book or a tie-in film; it's a spectacle for the theatre, one that is filled to the brim with fan service and magical imagery that will amaze." He says the relationship between Albus and Scorpius is "the friendship of two bullied boys bound together, and it's a beautiful, tender thing", adding: "The script by Jack Thorne recognizes that rejection breeds resentment, and outsiders stew into outcasts. The script of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is published this weekend. 
But on the other side of the world in the Pacific Ocean, Japan was still fighting against America, Britain and their allies. 80,000 people were killed as a direct result of the blast, and another 35,000 were injured. Three days later, another nuclear bomb was dropped by the Americans on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. There were 90,000 buildings in Hiroshima before the bomb was dropped but only 28,000 remained after the explosion. The allies were winning the war and the Japanese forces had been pushed back from many locations. It had invaded the countries near to it such as China and the Japanese had attacked America. It was the first and only time that atomic bombs have been used in a war. Today, a small number of countries around the world, including USA, China and the UK, have nuclear weapons. 
With the elegant panorama of Pembroke College behind them, the MPs wanted to find out what would be the impact of Brexit on the UK's university sector. The university had asked why potential students had turned down a chance to study at Cambridge - and she said among the reasons were fears over an "anti-immigrant sentiment" and uncertainty over the future of the UK's involvement in international research. The committee of MPs heard warnings that in some elite research institutions in the UK, vital to the national infrastructure, as many as two thirds of the staff were EU nationals from outside the UK. Or would research rivals in Germany or China snap them up to the detriment of the UK economy? If the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some "serious funding". What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will happen to the intricate networks of European research? 
"It is with deep regret and sadness that we confirm the passing away of three of our colleagues, Karthikeyan Ramasubramaniyam Pugalur, Rishi Rajeev Kumar, and Vivek Bhaskaran in a tragic road accident in the UK," a spokesman for the firm said. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who lost their lives in this tragedy." Father Biju Joseph, who conducted the Mass, confirmed Mr Joseph's wife and children, a 19-year-old man and girl aged 15, who attended the service, were told of his death by police on Saturday morning. Alex Daniel, a friend, said Mr Joseph was a "great leader" within the south Indian community in Nottingham. He said: "I'm not surprised by the amount of people who came here [to the service]. Thames Valley Police said the two men charged in connection with the crash also each faced four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Spokesmen for the two companies expressed sympathies to those who lost loved ones in the crash, and said the companies were assisting police with their inquiries. 
Since the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria. It was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground. It was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a "new Middle East". But it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since. 
The atmosphere in the stadium was electric and it was all because of this race. It was a fitting way to conclude a wonderful nine days of athletics in the Olympic Stadium. Bolt said London 2012 had been "amazing" and on the race added: "It's a wonderful feeling to end on a high note. 
The first minister said the Welsh Government wanted to assure businesses and inward investors that Wales remains open for business. Mr Jones is allocating £5m to the new Growth and Prosperity Fund to ensure the economy continued to grow and Wales continued to be an attractive destination for investment. "These actions will support Welsh businesses looking to grow and increase the number and scale of Welsh-based companies that are exporting," he said. She said as well as stability for the economy there needed to be action and the taskforce would bring together the "huge amount of experience" and specialist knowledge from business.

The Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath. Mildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move "will come as a shock to many", he said. "We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area." RAF Mildenhall is used as a transport hub by the USAF and is home to air refuelling tankers and special operations forces. James Waters, leader of the council, said: "The USAF contributes significantly to the local economy so the expansion of RAF Lakenheath, and with it the US government's commitment to the site as part of its long term plans, is very welcome. For some years now the US military has been reviewing its bases in Europe, eager to reduce its footprint to rationalise and cut costs. It is likely that the KC-135 tankers from Mildenhall will move to a US base in Germany. 
Els Borst had appeared at a conference of her liberal D66 party on Saturday and her death came as a shock to political colleagues in The Hague. For a time, she led her party in the 1990s and Prime Minister Mark Rutte said her death was a great loss for Dutch politics.

The cow was spotted alone in a field by Ms Boyko who, after hearing she might be destined for market, purchased the animal. Ms Boyko said on her Facebook page that Jeanie and her Cornish sponsor got along well: "I am pleased to say he was most impressed to meet the beautiful Jean and she was on her best behaviour." 
On a number of occasions he has voiced support for the Taliban insurgency against US forces in Afghanistan. Rahimullah Yusufzai is a political and security analyst and an expert on the Taliban, Afghanistan and Pakistan's north-west tribal region. He is the editor of The News daily in Peshawar, and has also been a correspondent for Time magazine and the BBC. Major Mohammad Amir is a former official of the ISI intelligence service who once gave training and logistics to the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He leads a faction of the Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam (Party of Islamic clergy) and was twice elected to Pakistan's senate. He is the head of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial chapter of the Islamist political party Jamaat-i-Islami, which is a vocal supporter of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. 
Everton's Romelu Lukaku, 22, tops the list for players born after 1993, having played 210 games so far for the Toffees, Anderlecht, Chelsea and West Brom.

What all of these prophets of AI doom wanted to do was to get the world thinking about where the science was heading - and make sure other voices joined the scientists in that debate. That they have achieved that aim was evident on Wednesday night at an event in Cambridge marking the opening of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, designed to do some of that thinking about the implications of AI. That, he said, could lead to the eradication of disease and poverty and the conquest of climate change. She pointed to the enthusiasm for the use of robots in the care of the elderly and sick and said society would have to ask whether this was dehumanising. Just one of the issues which will now be addressed by the Centre for the Future of Intelligence - and rather more urgent than the threat from some future Terminator. 
Family members claim Northumbria Police did not do enough to warn staff that Moat had told a 999 call handler he was hunting for officers on the night of the shooting. His brother, who lives in Australia, said of the 4 July anniversary of the shooting: "As a family we obviously reflect on past events that had such a tragic outcome for David. He said 4 July was a important date for the family, but that the "significant anniversary" was the date of PC Rathband's death when they lost a "very special man".

But Harrison's score following a line-out catch-and-drive moments before half-time gave Saints hope, and North ran from deep inside his own half to drag them to within four points early in the second period. Shortly after Northampton had a further try through Paul Hill ruled out for a high tackle, two Burns penalties stretched Leicester's lead back to 10 points - only for Gibson's touchdown against his former club and Myler's penalty with five minutes to go to leave the scores tied. "Credit to them for getting back into it, but credit to our players for the first 30 minutes and then for digging themselves out of a hole they probably shouldn't have got themselves into. "In the first half, we had a terrible 20 minutes - they were good, but we were terrible for 20 minutes - and you should not go 21-0 down at Welford Road." 
A two-year-old boy also suffered serious head injuries in the crash in Birmingham. 
Brengle, the world number 84, was a surprise finalist having come through qualifying, but the 24-year-old made the early running in the final. The service struggles continued in the wind and Watson twice fell a break behind but was able to hit back immediately each time, levelling at 3-3 after a scrappy 44 minutes. There was a hint of nerves when she slipped 15-30 behind while serving for the match, but Watson closed out the win and headed to the stands to hug coach Veronelli. "When I won Osaka in 2012, it was more of a surprise," said Watson. 
The NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis. The Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals. The Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support. At the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics. The figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen. Ms Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016. "Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by Â£150m of funding. 
The firm believes the details were accessed only by the security expert who alerted it to the problem. That figure was removed from the firm's statement - a spokesman for Kromtech told the BBC it had included both "active and non-active" users.

All three players could feature for the Championship promotion hopefuls against Ipswich on Saturday. 
But Channel 5 said it was "a measured account" of Michael's life and death. Ridgeley, who paid an emotional tribute to Michael at last month's Brit Awards, had called the programme a "piece of voyeurism" that should only have been aired "after a respectful period". 
Mr Frost, a teacher, has apologised "unreservedly" and deleted the posts. In a statement, Mr Frost said: "What I said was wrong and I apologise unreservedly. 
The trial on 62 patients, published in the Lancet, hints the medicine halted the progression of the disease. "There's absolutely no doubt the most important unmet need in Parkinson's is a drug to slow down disease progression, it's unarguable," Prof Tom Foltynie, one of the researchers, told the BBC. In Parkinson's, the brain is progressively damaged and the cells that produce the hormone dopamine are lost. In the trial, half of patients were given the diabetes drug exenatide and the rest were given a placebo (dummy treatment). Parkinson's progresses slowly and the difference in this 60-week trial was definitely there, but was "trivial" in terms of the impact on day-to-day life, say the researchers. 
The man Ms Glass is believed to have been referring to said he had spoken to her about to a Polish family in the area who he believed were living on benefits, describing them as "spongers", but denied being racist. "It is in the DNA of the Labour Party. Brendan Chilton, the general secretary of the Labour group campaigning for Brexit - Labour Leave - criticised Ms Glass's comments as "shocking". "A significant number of Labour voters want to leave the EU, and have justified concerns with immigration. 
In the other group, qualification will go down to the final day of matches, after bottom side Al Ahly finally recorded a win - beating leaders Wydad Casablanca 1-0. "There's a little bit of bragging rights in beating Zamalek, but we still have to do the business," he said. Enyimba and Zamalek play in the final round of group matches to decide which of them will join Sundowns in the last four. Ahly play Zesco and Asec take on Wydad in the final round of matches, so all four teams from Group A still have hopes of going through to the last four. 
It could be a burning issue or something you have always wondered about the area or its people. 
Earlier this month, a top appeals court cleared Mubarak of involvement in killing some of the 900 protesters who died during the country's uprising. A former general, Mubarak was one of the Arab world's most well known leaders. Recently, as Egypt has gone through waves of political and economic upheaval, many have come to look back at the Mubarak era as a time of relative calm and prosperity. "It was my greatest wish in life to see President Mubarak finish with his legal case," says Mr Hussein, who visited the former leader in the military hospital where he spent most of his time in custody. "I knew he was innocent from day one, because a man who once fought for the freedom of this country, would never kill its youth," he goes on. She has since been tried and acquitted of charges of posing a threat to national security. 
The castle's Great Hall of James IV is one of the few places where the enormous tapestry can be displayed in its entirety. 
In a June referendum, the UK voted to leave the EU causing global uncertainty over the fallout of the separation. In their letter, the bankers also said US companies in the UK rely on "passporting rights" between the UK and the remaining EU member states to allow UK-based firms to operate freely across the economic bloc. Substantive Brexit talks between the UK and the rest of the EU are unlikely to start much before the end of 2017, a former European Council president earlier this month told the BBC. 
Members of the GMB union voted strongly in favour of the deal, but it was rejected by Unite members. Members of the GMB union, which has 1,200 members working with Diageo in Scotland, voted by almost 3-1 in favour of accepting the deal. However, it is understood union officials will be speaking to Unite representatives at Diageo in the coming days. In a statement, the company said it was committed to "providing competitive and sustainable pensions". 
"Previously, stopping the bleeding could only be done in hospital, but one of the ways to buy yourself time is to replace the blood they're losing." 
That rather extended metaphor is perhaps one way to think about the subject of euro clearing. In return for that risk, buyers and sellers have to keep money in a special account with the clearing house in case there are problems. Some estimates put the cost of fragmenting this bit of the reef at an additional 77bn euros to the people that use them. This new raiding party is led by the EU Financial Services Commissioner Valdis Dombrovkis who is arguing that either the EU has greater policing powers over clearing in London (a cup of cold sick in political and regulatory terms) or, the business has to relocate to the EU (two cups). It's not clear, however, that a defeat for London would be a victory for the EU. Some euro clearing also happens in the US and many think that the way firms will minimise the cost of disruption and fragmentation will be to do their business in New York - another big reef - which would only serve to weaken Europe as a whole in the global financial power league. 
The dead woman, who has not been named but is believed to be in her 50s, was found at a house in Holmfield Avenue on Saturday. 
The department was subject to a Serious Case Review after the death of five-year-old Tyler Whelan, murdered by his mother's former partner in March 2011. A re-inspection of children's services in August 2011 again found the overall effectiveness of the department to be inadequate. "They found the lessons of the past had been taken very seriously and [the council] had invested considerably in additional social workers," Mrs Westcott said. 
Cardiff council said train services into the city would be busy all day, with extra capacity on Marches, north Wales and Ebbw Vale lines after 21:30. Cardiff Queen Street station closed at 18:45 and queues at Cardiff Central after the match are expected to exceed two hours. 
"I tend to only remember a lot of the bad things and also the feelings," he said. "I desperately wanted more than anything else in my life not to be an alcoholic, but when I was 12 or 13 and found alcohol, it just became the perfect escape route for me. "I knew it was never right and never their medicine," said the 25-year-old. "When he went on to heroin, I was about ten years old and he was a mess. "He knew how much I adored him and I knew he adored me, I knew I was the only thing he cared about, apart from the drug. "I missed the old dad he was and always wished I could have the old dad back." "It reminds me of the time I was looking after my dad, the feelings I got from that and the embarrassment, shame and sadness." 
Councils in Kettering and Bedford objected to the cinema and bowling alley. 
Wada says Ukad will take control of drug-testing in Russia as long as the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) remains non-compliant with Wada's code. 
This is the first time Moyes has been relegated as a manager, and he warned fans just two games into the the season that he thought they would struggle. "I feel for the supporters because they're the people who pay their hard-earned cash to come and watch and we've not given them enough this season," said the former Everton and Manchester United manager. "My feeling at the start of the season was it was going to be a hard graft, and I'd rather be up front with people than tell them something different." The defeat by Bournemouth was the ninth time Sunderland have failed to score in their past 10 games, and the 18th time they have failed to do so this season. In the early part of the season he was getting them and finishing them." Short said: "I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment, and as a result we have found ourselves struggling to survive in recent seasons. A £28m net spend in the last three transfer windows is comparable with teams in and around them, but I worry for Sunderland. The rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top. Those Sunderland fans are seeing a team and a club that I think has lacked leadership from the boardroom. 
The Scottish Police Federation has been made aware of the incident. 
Mr Bazley, described by Hafren Power as its founder and "the visionary" behind the barrage, describes himself as a "serial entrepreneur". He declined to be interviewed but Hafren Power chief executive Tony Pryor denied Mr Bazley's background undermined the credibility of the project. But they should not detract from the legitimacy of the barrage and its importance to Wales and the West of England." Supporters of the barrage say the privately-financed project could generate up to 5% of Britain's energy needs by using more than 1,000 turbines and tidal power. A similar project was rejected by the UK government in 2010 on grounds of cost, but Hafren Power says the revised barrage would overcome that issue and also be more environmentally friendly. 
It said the move was part of the Sustainability and Transformation Plan for Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In November it was revealed, the part of the Sustainability and Transformation Plan affecting community hospitals will be outlined after next May. 
It is a stance employers' organisation the CBI wants other firms to emulate, arguing it will improve diversity. In a report aimed at encouraging employers to hire a broader range of people from varied social backgrounds, age groups, races and gender the CBI suggests advertising flexible working at the outset. Just one in ten job adverts mention flexible working, despite more than half of employers offering it, meaning they miss out on a wider pool of applicants, according to the report. It says the move was aimed at making "flexible working a right rather than an exception" and has seen a "significant increase" in the number of people who have taken up flexible working. 
An alternative option was to set a flat rate of tax relief, which may have been unpopular with higher earners. Mr Osborne had been expected to unveil changes in the Budget on 16 March, but a Treasury source said it was "not the right time" to make changes to pension tax relief. The relief allows some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax to go into their pension instead. The proposal to introduce arrangements similar to an Isa, with no tax relief on contributions but with withdrawals free of tax, would have given a significant short-term boost to the government at the expense of lower tax revenue later. If the chancellor had scrapped the tax relief entirely on pensions savings and created instead a new pensions Isa, that would have cost the better off (40p and 45p taxpayers) billions of pounds collectively. The other proposal which had been reported was to create a new pension tax relief rate of 25p or even 33p. He called for a "period of stability" in pensions policy in the interest of encouraging people to save for the long term. The way the relief works is that some of a person's earnings that would have been taken by government in tax can be contributed to their pension instead. 
"There were a couple of clashes of egos between the coaches and the athletes in both groups," said Kilty. I know there is still tension between the other athletes in our group and their group and the two coaches "I'm on speaking terms and friendly with the others, but I know there is still tension between the other athletes in our group and their group and the two coaches." 
And it was only the efforts of his computer programmer son Mark which got his business back up and running. "It's not just the big companies that have been attacked," John told the BBC. When John opened his doors that day as usual, he had little idea of the problems that lay in store. "None of the software would work on our network of computers in the office," he said. But my son said there was no guarantee they would unencrypt the files after we had paid and they might ask for more money." "I was worried about the security of our clients but they didn't access any of that part. 
The efforts always figured to be an uphill battle, however, given the issues and interests that formed the heart of Mr Trump's presidential campaign. 
Last year the authorities learned of 946 victims, compared with 710 in 2010, the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking said. Trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria and eastern Europe now pose the biggest threat to the UK , it said. However, the report said 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the National Referral Mechanism, the official body that identifies and looks after those caught up in trafficking. Of the victims referred in 2010, 524 were adults and 186 were children. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre estimates there are about 300 child trafficking victims in the UK every year. Det Insp Kevin Hyland, of London's Metropolitan Police - which sees the UK's highest rates of trafficking - said some victims travelled to the UK in lorries or containers but the majority arrived lawfully, often accompanied by their traffickers. "The vast majority of them think they're coming to a better life in the UK," he said. The report revealed the largest number of referrals of potential victims of trafficking were Nigerian nationals. The two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant. But it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association. "One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence." 
However, the board has also welcomed the new owner and "looks forward to innovations" that will help the prison. During the process, the Prison Service was also bidding to retain the contract and inmates were said to be concerned about the privatisation. 
"To continue to work with a player of his calibre and a man of his quality is something fantastic for the club. "He brings so much with his talent, his state of mind and ability to motivate the group, we could not afford to lose the opportunity to extend his contract. We are happy that Enyeama is able to finish his career at Lille." 
The birth of one of pop music's biggest beefs all started when Kanye West jumped on stage in the middle of Taylor Swift accepting her award for best female video. Kanye was booed by he audience, and when Beyonce herself accepted the award for video of the year later in the ceremony, she invited Swift back onstage to finish her speech. In 2010, the pop star accepted her video of the year award in a dress made from raw beef. The dress was condemned by several animal rights groups but went on to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Critics cited this moment as a turning point for Britney's career - between the song and the costume, she did a pretty good job of trying to shed that Mickey Mouse Club image and show the world she was growing up. Taylor Swift took this as a jab directed at her and responded on Twitter, after which the two engaged in a war of words. And then Miley weighed in on the topic. As Nicki accepted her award on stage and handed back to Miley, who was hosting the ceremony, she said: "And now, back to this [girl] that had a lot to say about me the other day in the press. After finishing her performance of We Can't Stop in 2013, the singer was joined on stage by Robin Thicke and that's when things got a little... R-rated. 
"In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advises passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage," the FAA said. Following Samsung's recall of its Galaxy Note 7, Qantas said on Thursday it was "requesting that passengers who own [the devices] do not switch on or charge them in-flight." Samsung has said customers who have already bought the phone will be able to swap it for a new one and that it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices. The US trade group Airlines for America said it was "closely monitoring" the Note 7 issue and that carriers in the US would make their own ruling over the use of the phone on board. 
First Minister Arlene Foster said the terms for an independent inquiry were worked out in consultation with the attorney general. 
Swansea have yet to receive a bid this summer for the Spain international, who scored 15 goals last season to help the Welsh club avoid relegation from the top flight. Bony's high wages at City were thought to be a stumbling block for a potential return to the Liberty Stadium, though Swansea could soon have more money if midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson joins Everton. 
Ricciardo has a contract until the end of 2018 but there have been doubts about the future of Kvyat after an up-and-down first season with the team. Team principal Christian Horner said: "Ricciardo's contract is fixed and all the options are on our side with Kvyat. Insiders say that Red Bull are now likely to continue with Renault but with the engine given a different name so it does not appear to casual audience as if the relationship has continued. 
The All Blacks great is not only a physical throw-back in a game increasingly for the outsized and enormous. It's not that Carter doesn't do the nasty stuff. Carter is not quite the player he was. The outside break and sudden acceleration that defined so many of his early masterclasses have quietly been lost to the years. And it is all done in the most unobtrusive way. The fact that he has been the same with ball in hand - perfectly timed passes or offloads, but all done in the most discreet and understated way - have sometimes made it hard for people to understand what has made him so special. Carter isn't the only sporting great who can appear to be operating in slow-motion and fast-forward at the same time, but he maintains that composure longer than most. Carter, in the biggest moments he has faced, has looked as perturbed as if he were back at Christchurch Boys' High School, from the second Test against the Lions in 2005, when he turned in a performance that led to him being described as "the perfect 10", all the way through to last October's World Cup final. A week after adding another to put away South Africa in the semi-finals, he took a pass flat with the defence charging, his feet and eyes set for the short pass to Sonny Bill Williams on his outside shoulder. After his yellow card in the critical World Cup group match against Australia and the two-week ban for a dangerous tackle after Saracens' Champions Cup semi-final win over Wasps, he will be watching Carter not just to keep his influence in check but to learn from the old master too. "It's just how calm he is, how much he is in control of what he does that stands out," the fiery Farrell says. 
Councillor Pat Karney said he wanted to discuss the problem with Home Secretary Amber Rudd because "the experience in Manchester is going to spread up and down this country". "What is happening in Manchester will happen nationally so the next steps we're taking is to see the chief constable and review the situation, and then we're going to be seeking a meeting with the home secretary," he said. "The fact of the matter is that more and more addicts are dying and the addiction problem continues to rise. 
A video combining all 1,200 performances was shown at Proms in the Park events around the UK and as part of BBC Two's coverage of the event. Peruvian Juan Diego Florez chose to sing the anthem in B Major - the highest pitch ever chosen by a tenor at the event. There was also a distinctly international flavour to the programme, conducted by Sakari Oramo, the Finnish music director of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Perhaps in response to the planned protest, Oramo told the audience: "Listening to music in a concentrated way gives us the chanceâ€¦ to find resolution, peace and unity. The concert also included Michael Torke's Javelin, which was originally performed at the opening ceremony of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a hand-picked selection of young singers performing Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music - a tribute to Henry Wood, whose name is synonymous with the Proms. Thirteen-year-old Gwydion Rhys was given the opportunity to conduct the BBC National Orchestra of Wales in a performance of Ride of the Valkyries at the Welsh Prom, in Colwyn Bay. 
"Moussa told me the club was good, it was fun here," said his fellow 21-year-old, who spent the last two seasons on loan with Genoa in Serie A. "I'm very happy to be here and it's a new challenge for me." "He knows not all clubs are in the Champions League, so if you play in the Champions League, it's always good to stay," said Ntcham. Ntcham revealed he held talks with Celtic back in January and says a desire to play regular first-team football was a key factor in his decision to leave England's top flight and join Brendan Rodgers' squad. 
Councillor Dean Collins, from the county council, said: "The new station will be a great boost to the area. A number of road closures will be in place while the old footbridge is taken down and the new one erected. 
Det Con Stephen Cooke, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a deliberate and dangerous act which has caused extensive damage to the centre. 
Like the issue of electricity in Iraq, the failure of a public utility in Lebanon - rubbish collection - has brought to a head simmering, chronic public indignation over a deadlocked political system riddled with corruption, inefficiency and sectarianism. Mr Salam's warning of an imminent collapse should be a wake-up call to those blocs that it is time to collaborate on solutions, not least to the 15-month vacancy at the country's presidency. If it can at least get the rubbish collected and safely disposed of, that will be a start. "The movement has not and will not stop," a statement on its Facebook page said. Activists blame political paralysis and corruption for the failure to resolve the crisis. The conflict in neighbouring Syria has also exacerbated political and sectarian divisions, and resulted in the arrival of 1.1 million refugees, putting a strain on the economy and public services. Mr Salam said that if a cabinet meeting scheduled for Thursday was not productive on several issues, including the rubbish crisis, "there would be no necessity for the government after it". 
Fox Norton has been a model of consistency since joining the Tizzard team, and was a close second to Special Tiara in the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He was not inconvenienced by the return to two miles, with the strong pace set by Un De Sceaux and Rock The World playing to his strengths. "The horse made a few mistakes and Robbie said he was going flat out the whole time. "That was his minimum and if there had been a two-and-a-half-miler here he would have been in that. 
"You are going to get the best of British competing cheek-by-jowl against the best of the rest of the world. The track and field is the centrepiece of the Olympics and is the main event. She is definitely the woman to beat in the 800m." That athletics event remains the Games' ultimate showstopper and all eyes will be trained on Usain Bolt in the men's final on Sunday 5 August. But athletics is not just about the track events; there are 47 medal events in all and just over half of these (24) are on the track. For those unable to get tickets for the Olympic Stadium, there are five road races being held on the streets of central London and finishing at the Mall. A packed calendar of events happening in stadiums and running tracks throughout the UK can be found on the Academy's website. More on the UK Athletics website 'Join In Local Sport' aims to get as many people as possible to turn up and take part in activities at their local sports facilities on 18/19 August, 2012 - the first weekend between the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The aim of the initiative is for every sports club and community group in the UK to put on a special event in a bid to encourage more people to get involved as members, supporters or volunteers. The word athletics is derived from the Greek word 'athlos,' which means "contest" or "task," and the sport was first run in an Olympic format in that part world. Athletics has been on the programme of each edition of the Games since 1896, with women's events appearing for the first time at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. 
Mr Flanagan said: "Despite the fine words of politicians on the need to support schools and teachers, the evidence from both the recent EIS workload survey - which highlighted an average teacher working week of 46.5 hours - and the range of motions to this year's AGM indicate that excessive workload remains a huge issue for teachers and, therefore, for our schools and our pupils." A call for the EIS to "investigate and report on the impact of teacher shortages" will also be discussed at the conference, along with a motion condemning "budget cuts which have been inflicted on Scottish education in recent years". 
However it is possible that not all the requests will be spotted - and they may not all be genuine. "If you're in an extreme situation, and you can't get access through formal channels, and there is the prospect of help from somewhere else helping your signal to be seen, it would be tough not to." 
The Welsh Government is seeking £6.8m from the UK government to cover three quarters of the cost of a new station. Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he had submitted a "strong" application for 75% of the cost of the new station - the maximum the UK Government could cover.

He was found to be in possession of more than 1,000 still and moving images of children. Fuggle was released on bail on the conditions that he does not go to Colet Court school, or be in the company of anyone under the age of 16 unless supervised. 
AMC chief executive Adam Aron had suggested the idea might encourage so-called millennials to visit the cinema. But the cinema chain has now admitted the idea had not gone down well with audiences. "This is an idea we have relegated to the cutting room floor... there will be no texting allowed in any of the auditoriums at AMC Theatres." 
Francis used his "Urbi et Orbi" address to call for peace in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and across the globe. In past years there have been two parts to the Pope's Easter message - a heartfelt appeal for peace in the world's trouble spots, and multilingual  greetings to the crowds thronging St Peter's Square. Pope Francis was, however, almost incomprehensible when he tried out a few words in English to the crowds in St Peter's Square last week. In his Urbi et Orbi (To the city and the world) speech, Pope Francis began with a simple "Happy Easter!" The Pope then mentioned troubled regions of the world in turn. For Africa, the Pope referred to Mali, Nigeria - "where attacks sadly continue" - the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. In the days before Easter, the Pope had reached out to women and Muslims. In his Easter homily, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Fouad Twal, invited the Pope to visit. 
"Serious" errors in the council's air quality data readings, from 2012 to 2014, made them appear lower than they really were, an external investigation has revealed. Defra said the data provided "an overview of pollution in locations where people are likely to be present and reveals historic trends which indicate whether policies to improve air quality are having the desired effect". An internal review by Cheshire East Council auditors in 2016 found the air quality data submitted was different to the original data provided by the laboratory that analysed readings from the council's monitoring equipment. 
In a blog, the firm said the new language emphasised it would "not tolerate behaviour intended to harass or intimidate". In its update, however, the firm said it had introduced a range of new protections in 2015, including new tools for reporting abusive behaviour and a ban on the "promotion of terrorism". 
Experts in the field will come together to share the latest evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding, review what is working well and identify ways to drive up rates. A key focus will be on increasing rates of breastfeeding in the most deprived areas in order to help reduce health inequalities. 
In a speech on Tuesday, Royal College of Physicians president Prof Jane Dacre will warn ministers the issue must be addressed if their policy is to work. Prof Dacre will raise her own concerns at the RCP's annual conference in Harrogate, saying NHS trusts are struggling to find enough staff to cope with existing demands. Across the country, they have created a raft of new posts to meet the rising demands for patient care, only to find that there is no-one to fill them. 
"By doing this research, we hope to raise more awareness and to encourage further examination of the subject." Bruinvels is using crowdfunding to aid the next stage of her research, which will focus on heavy menstrual bleeding and the possible increase of iron deficiency. 
The president has attempted to win the rebels' trust through a series of confidence-building measures. The ceasefires have been marred by the killings of soldiers and rebels. The rebels, who say they will not give up arms even if a deal is reached, have accused the military of using Mr Duterte's drug war as a pretext to mount operations in rebel areas amid the ceasefire. The CPP demands that the government grant a general amnesty to these rebels as part of negotiations. Since the last round of talks in October, the rebels have also taken issue with some of Mr Duterte's policies at home and abroad. 
I have been impressed with his attitude and I am looking forward to working with him," Morecambe boss Jim Bentley told the club website. 
The Welsh government said it is working with Powys to minimise the impact of cuts to learning. Council cabinet member for learning Myfanwy Alexander said: "Changes to the way post-16 funding is delivered and a decline in pupil numbers have had a severe impact on Powys sixth forms. "The post-16 sector remains a key priority for this government and we are working closely with colleagues in Powys and across Wales to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning." 
In a statement, Opec said its members were committed to a "stable and balanced oil market". Opec members produce 40% of the world's crude oil. A meeting of most Opec members, along with other oil exporters including Russia, similarly failed to cap output following a meeting in Qatar in April. 
Tigers registered a penalty try, but after the break Alex Waller and Ben Foden went over for the champions and Niki Goneva scored two of his own. It was all in spite of Saints captain Hartley's indiscretion, the latest on a growing rap sheet throughout his career which will raise questions about his credentials to represent England, regardless of whether his inevitable ban stretches into next year's Six Nations. With two separate brawls having broken out on the pitch, replays showed that Hartley's elbow connected with Smith's chin during a scuffle, and referee JP Doyle took the advice of the television match official to send off the 28-year-old. After missing last year's British & Irish Lions tour of Australia with an 11-week ban after being dismissed for swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Premiership final - also against the Tigers - Hartley, by his own admission, was in the last chance saloon when it came to his England career. With just 17 minutes having passed when he trudged off the field, Saints, like in the 2013 final, were once again without their captain and facing an uphill battle. Owen Williams slotted the conversion and Stephen Myler put over a penalty for Saints, before Tigers' Tom Croft was sin-binned moments before the break for a high tackle. Myler collected the points off the tee and after the interval Saints capitalised on Croft's absence, pinning Tigers back into their 22 and freeing up Salesi Ma'afu to pass on to Waller for the score. Fourteen-man Saints once again validated their status as champions and Premiership leaders, though, when Luther Burrell, who was a powerhouse all afternoon, burst forward, allowing the ball to go through the hands to Foden for a superb finish from 35 metres. But, remarkably, Saints found time for one more push and, from a line-out, swept the ball across the pitch for Elliott to clinch an unlikely and thrilling victory. 
"The risk of recession in the second half of 2016 has therefore all but evaporated, and the solid PMI readings for September will cast doubt on the need for any further stimulus from the Bank of England in coming months." In addition, September's survey indicated that new business in services rose at the fastest pace since February and that the rate of job creation had picked up. 
A blue Citroen C3 hit a house near the Conrah Hotel on the A487 in Chancery at about 02:15 BST on Friday. 
Universities have long argued the grant means tens of millions of pounds leaves the higher education sector in Wales and goes to the coffers of their counterparts in England. Earlier this year, the head of the body responsible for allocating funding to universities in Wales said the Welsh government needs to change how it funds students from Wales to avoid universities here falling behind their English counterparts. In 2013, BBC Wales revealed the body representing universities here had concerns they were losing out compared to their counterparts in England because of the tuition fee grant. In November 2013, the Welsh government announced a review of higher education funding and student finance arrangements in Wales, which is chaired by the Scottish academic, Professor Ian Diamond. 
Channel 4 has also fined Glasspool an undisclosed sum which he will give to a domestic violence charity. He will also be donating a fee to a domestic violence charity." 
In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Yousaf admitted that ScotRail's performance was not "up to scratch" but he said it was higher than the UK average. He added: "I know about the work that is required and the service that is to be delivered. ScotRail was ordered to produce a performance improvement plan in September after punctuality and reliability fell below the expected standard. Mr Yousaf agreed to speak to ScotRail about its publication in the interests of "accountability and transparency". He added: "His handling of the rail crisis has seen him fall out with Abellio, Network Rail and the transport unions. 
"There's a Championship club after Bacuna, that looks close to being over the line too." 
The coastguard said Mr Robinson had been walking on rocks on the western end of the beach at about 16:30 GMT when he slipped and injured his leg. With no means of calling for help, he dragged himself off the rocks back on to the beach and then crawled in the darkness towards Seatown. He was eventually discovered by his wife who had gone to look for him and she raised the alarm. 
Economists had expected the economy to suffer from the government's decision to withdraw high-denomination banknotes as part of an anti-corruption drive. However, Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Holdings, said the current year's growth "appears to be overstated as our National Accounts Statistics does not adequately capture activities from the unorganised sector". 
The abandonment of Selby's fight against Barros could delay those plans but, whenever it may happen, it is a fight Khan would like to see materialise. "The fight between Santa Cruz and Frampton is for a world title so unifying it and to have it [a Selby-Frampton fight] in the UK would be massive. The featherweight division is one of boxing's most competitive and open at the moment, and a bout between Selby and three-time world champion Mares would also excite Khan. I think that would be a good fight for Abner to have. 
The 28-year-old, who has played 27 of Barcelona's 32 games this season, left the pitch on a stretcher in the eighth minute of the match following a challenge from Nicolas Escalante. 
Mr Calombaris said the group was first alerted to the issue in 2015 by Australia's Fair Work Ombudsman. Former staff have been encouraged to contact the company. 
However, it warned that more needed to be done to ensure the improvements continued, including the introduction of a minimum price for alcohol. Clare Beeston, from NHS Health Scotland, said the country continued to "pay a heavy price" for high levels of alcohol consumption. "These are to reduce the affordability, availability and promotion of alcohol. "A minimum unit price for alcohol is one of the best ways to reduce drinking in the heaviest drinkers and tackle the alcohol related health inequalities." 
She said her daughter was angry after the consultation, as he "did not seem to listen to her" and suggested she go for a massage or a spa day, despite her complaining of leg and back pain and tightness in her chest. In his evidence to the hearing, Dr Simon said he had "no concerns" during the appointment that Miss Foster had been suffering from a pulmonary embolism. Dr Nigel Tuft, a consultant at the Princess Royal Hospital, told the hearing that CT scans had shown she was not suffering from any tumours likely to have caused the pulmonary embolism. 
He is said to have gone to Syria because he was "horrified by the atrocities being carried out" there. In a statement, his family said: "We are devastated to confirm the death of our son Konstandinos Erik Scurfield in Syria where he went to support the forces opposing Islamic State. "His family's understanding was that he travelled to Syria hoping to provide medical and humanitarian support as an expert in battlefield medicine." He joined the YPG, a secular group that has proven to be very effective against IS in Syria and Iraq, on 7 December. The Kurdish sources say that in a video, which is not publicly available yet, Mr Scurfield says he "joined the YPG to fight against IS". He said if Britons went to Syria and were suspected of trying to join IS they would get their "collar felt at Heathrow" - but there "seems to be a silence about people going to fight on the other side". 
Morrisons has so far declined to comment on their plans for the site. But the plans were put on hold due to the recession.

The victim said he was tortured to the point of "death's door" and in a statement said the psychological injuries would never completely heal. The court heard that he was also told he was "stupid" to "mess with the IRA" and that Jonathan Dowdall was a good friend of the party's president Gerry Adams and his deputy, Mary Lou McDonald. 
He said it would counteract the Army School of the Americas in Georgia which trained US allies during the Cold War. In Latin America, some officers trained at the US-based School of the Americas went on to commit some of the worse human rights abuses in the region. The former Guatemalan President, General Efraim Rios Montt, also trained at  the School of the Americas in the 1950s. 
The woman was attacked between Main Street and Cross Arthurlie Street, Barrhead, sometime between 22:00 on Friday and 22:00 on Saturday. 
One Facebook post, from Jodi Taylor, said: "My god-daughter goes to this school and this is just a few of the things they threaten. A parent, also writing on Facebook, said that the idea was an "absolute disgrace", adding: "My boys go to this school. He said there had been a very small minority of parents who did not sign up to the idea. A letter to parents said: "Any student whose behaviour disrupts the learning of others will be expected to stand up at the front in their faculty assembly, face their peers, and apologise to the whole faculty for letting them down. Mr Tutt said students at risk of being excluded were offered a range of support and given pastoral care, because the school did everything it could to avoid permanent exclusions. 
The EU says the settlements are illegal, but Israel disputes this. 
The survey indicates a drop in support for Labour and Sinn Féin, with Fianna Fáil and Independents improving their position. The Irish broadcaster suggests that Sinn Féin will be disappointed by a major slide in the numbers backing the party.

The family has appealed against the decision to deport them and the case will be heard in the High Court. If the appeal is unsuccessful Lawand and his family will be deported to Germany, as the government says this is where they should have claimed asylum, says the boy's school in Derby. 
The US Navy released video on Monday of a Russian plane passing as close as 500 metres to the USS Ross. "The crew of the ship acted provocatively and aggressively, which concerned the operators of monitoring stations and ships of the Black Sea Fleet," according to a military source quoted by Russian state media. 
The results will be sent to a supercomputing centre, which is where the maths comes in. The techniques developed at Strathclyde and on the continent can produce a 3D image of the brain - and its injury - within 15 minutes. One of the mathematics team is Dr Victorita Dolean, a Reader in Strathclyde's Department of Mathematics and Statistics. "The data will be sent to a supercomputing centre. "We have designed some open source software that is able to reconstruct, precisely and in real time, an image of the brain and then send it back to the doctors to interpret this data and make the diagnosis." 
Pulis said last week that, while West Brom "don't need or want to sell" captain Evans, "every player is for sale at the right price". Evans, who has two years left on his contract, missed West Brom's opening two Premier League games against Bournemouth and Burnley with a hamstring injury and is expected to miss for Saturday's visit of Stoke. 
"The reduction in north Pembrokeshire is in line with the national reduction, so right now, we have no evidence that the vaccination programme in badgers is delivering an additional benefit - and we wouldn't expect to see any evidence at this stage either," she said. But Dr Glossop said that the wider TB eradication programme cost £28m last year alone, most of which was spent on testing cattle, biosecurity and compensating farmers. 
Scotland and Ireland are in Pool A, along with the hosts. Wales will face Australia in a repeat of the 2015 tournament, at which both beat hosts England to qualify from the group stage. England will face Argentina in two Tests in June - both of which will be broadcast live on the BBC - and Jones will use the series to "practise a little bit" against the Pumas. Speaking of England's other pool opponent, the Australian added: "France have really improved over the past two years and are certainly a dangerous team." England head coach Eddie Jones: "We want to win the World Cup in 2019, and to win it, we need to be ready to play and beat anyone. So England and Wales could meet in the quarter-finals, with the winner potentially facing a semi-final against New Zealand. 
Vice-president of United World Wrestling, Georgy Bryusov said: "The IOC will not deprive Besik Kudukhov of his silver medal". 
Johnson confirmed his departure and the Scottish Rugby Union announced that he will be available for the June tour to Australia, Fiji and Samoa. "I feel that now is the right time for me to move on to other challenges but I remain 100% committed to the Ospreys between now and the end of the season." The real legacy he [Johnson] will leave is the systems and structures he has helped to develop that will allow us to continue leading the way in Wales In 2008 he became USA coach and left the following year to return to Wales with the Ospreys. Scotland coach Robinson was a Woodward assistant on that tour and has sought someone of the right calibre to be his right-hand man. At the 2011 World Cup Scotland failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time and Robinson is keen to emulate the template that brought the All Blacks success at the tournament. 
"I did not feel comfortable in the car. I wasn't able to brake in the same places and I made too many mistakes." Hamilton has a potential problem for the race because it is unclear whether he has a set of tyres in good enough condition to start. "There was a bit of reorganising because in Q3 Lewis had an off in front of me and I had to abort that lap and do one more at the end. He said: "They have done a great job up to now with the track. "We have seen one of the most exciting sessions for a long time and that is down to the track and I am sure the race is going to be very exciting. "It is one of the easiest places to overtake so a lot of places changing and probably some safety cars." 
Ipswich had the option to extend Berra's deal for a further 12 months, but agreed not to take it up to allow him to return closer to home. 
He said another possible reason for a lack of interest from parishioners was because the parish system was confusing, although the picture around the rest of the island was more encouraging. He said there was also a chance the election could be thrown out at the electors' meeting and it would not go ahead until another candidate comes forward. 
A Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust spokeswoman said there had been "15 per cent more attendances in the Emergency Department compared to this time last year". He said patients were waiting for more than two hours outside the hospital. 
Sir Philip had put a "substantial" recovery plan in place to resolve the deficit in pension schemes at Top Shop owner Arcadia, Mr Field said. In 2012, while BHS was under the ownership of Sir Philip, a 23-year plan to fix the pension deficit was agreed. Mr Field described that plan as "ludicrous" and contrasted it with a 13-year recovery plan for Arcadia pension schemes, which included much bigger contributions to cover the deficit. 
Swansea council said it was contacted by South Wales Evening Post after readers reported the problem in Townhill and Mayhill to the paper.

Once in a relationship, the Oxford University study found kissing was a way of getting a partner to stick around. The study found that kissing was particularly important to women in long-term relationships. Women valued kissing most at the start of a relationship and around the time they were most likely to conceive in their cycle.

Mr Wylie, who almost lost his voice in the effort, said: "I decided to give it my all and my all is what it took." Having been Calne's town crier since 2007, Mr Wylie normally dons a heavy, "made-to-fit" uniform in the colours of the town's flag. 
The research team found that the electrostatic coating of insecticide killed more mosquitoes than other nettings and, for certain insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, was 100% effective. She also said the new method would be suitable for a number of different types of chemical insecticide. 
A direct listing would save the music service the underwriting fees needed to launch an initial public offering (IPO), and would avoid diluting the value of existing stakes in the company. Whereas with an IPO new investors can buy shares from existing investors the day before trading begins, with a direct listing investors buy shares on the open market on the day they are listed for the going rate. The bank also looks at the company as part of the process for setting a reasonable initial offer price for the shares. The underwriters "build a book" - that is, they go to institutional investors to gauge the appetite for the shares in the company that's going to be floated. So as time ticks by, Spotify has to pay more to its creditors, and give them more of a discount on shares. 
He added: "I don't think the results of the survey are hugely surprising as it is the sort of common problem most of us have experience of - whether at home or increasingly in the office. "The advantage of the new solution from EE and Three is that you don't need that bit of kit." 
The results indicated that just 3.4% of "No" voters saw "The Vow" as the main motivation for their decision. Report co-author Ailsa Henderson, of the University of Edinburgh, said: "There is clearly a divergence between the perception among Yes voters that the offer of more powers was an important aspect of the campaign and reality of how No voters reached their decision. A spokesman for the SNP said: "While we were disappointed with the result of the referendum, this study shows that a clear legacy has been greater political involvement, particularly amongst young people, and that is something to be proud of. "Polling conducted immediately after the referendum showed that a quarter of No voters regarded the promise of extra powers as important in informing their decision - and nearly 10% of No voters only made up their mind in the last week. 
Fellow NI runner Paul Pollock was also inside the standard but his 2:15.38 was only the fourth Irish finisher. "Three weeks ago I had an 11 centimetre tear in my quad so I wasn't able to run for about 10 days and then it was a week of two or three miles a day," said the 28-year-old, whose time was 52 seconds inside his previous personal best set in Dublin in 2012. 
Minh To, of Stockport, Greater Manchester said he was left "scared" and "terrified" after seeing pictures of the five-bedroom home on Rightmove. Police later discovered two men had stolen his mail and forged his signature in order to falsify the documents needed to auction the house. Mike Haley, deputy chief executive of the fraud prevention organisation CIFAS, said Mr To had been "more vulnerable" to the fraud because he had paid off his mortgage. Mr To logged on to the website to find the advert featured several pictures of his home and was inviting bids starting at £300,000. Mr To discovered the advert just three days before the auction was due to commence. The court heard Ghani had carried out a similar fraud targeting a couple in Bolton, using fraudulent passports to transfer the deeds to their £300,000 house into his name. 
A Metrolink driver reported a collision involving a tram and a pedestrian at about 19:45 BST on Sunday, Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man died at the scene. Metrolink said "a good service" was in operation on all lines on Monday and trams were operating in and out of Victoria. 
The blaze started at the detached building in Drivers End in Codicote, near Welwyn, during the morning. 
The opening defeat by Chelsea was a chastening reintroduction to Premier League football for the Clarets, who were overwhelmed in midfield, and they were similarly outnumbered by Swansea. Latching on to Sigurdsson's through ball, Dyer scampered into the penalty area and shot low into the net despite a touch from Burnley keeper Heaton. "I want them to play with freedom, quality and energy and I thought we did that in the second half. We want to play on the front foot, create chances and win games." 
The Gambia has not had a smooth transfer of power since independence. The results of the election are said to be expected later tonight. The Gambia has a unique way of voting for the president. Mr Jammeh's supporters say he has spread education and health care to remote parts of the country. The African Union, however, has despatched a handful of observers to supervise the vote. Mamma Kandeh of the Gambia Democratic Congress is also in the race. 
After talks with UN and Arab diplomats in Geneva, he said progress had been made on a plan to reduce violence in the second city of Aleppo. He said the nine-week-old cessation of hostilities had had "a profoundly positive effect" and saved many lives, but in recent weeks it had been "put to the test". The US secretary of state said a recent air strike on a hospital in Aleppo, which he blamed on the Syrian government, was "unconscionable" but he added that both sides, the opposition and the regime, had contributed to "this chaos". At the start of a meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Monday, Mr Kerry said he would press rebel groups in Aleppo to separate themselves from the powerful jihadist group, al-Nusra Front. The Syrian government and Russia have said the Aleppo air strikes are targeting only al-Nusra, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda and is excluded from the cessation of hostilities along with the rival Islamic State group. After at least 50 people were killed in a reported government air strike on a hospital last Wednesday night, the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that Aleppo was being "pushed further to the brink of humanitarian disaster". 
The US has said the vote will not be credible but President Omar al-Bashir insists it will be free and fair. But the BBC's West Africa Correspondent Thomas Fessy, who recently visited Darfur with Mr Bashir, says many of those who initially wanted this referendum will be likely to boycott the vote because they say it will not be fair. Mr Bashir - who has told the BBC he will step down as president in 2020 - has dismissed the ICC as a "political tribunal". 
Given Gatland is under contract until the 2019 World Cup, Davies said he "may well look to see if there's a need to renew the coaching set-up". "It's not just when you fail to get out of the group that needs to be done, like all the focus has been on England. Gatland's worth to Wales was highlighted in December 2013 when he was given a contract extension until 2019 and Davies fully expects him to see it through. 
Liverpool probably thought the game was going to be a lot easier than it turned out to be. "Swansea, to go away from home and score three goals at Anfield or anywhere in the Premier League is a terrific achievement. 
"West Bromwich Albion indicated that they had no intention of changing their stance on selling Saido Berahino in advance of deadline day, and were true to their word, despite endless hyping of the possibility from outside. "The one deadline day signing day they did make was talented young midfielder Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur."

The executors of the will interpreted this to be a donation to the political party in power, and both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats accepted the donation. It would in this instance have been helpful for the will to have contained a clause that covered this scenario, or if the wording was a little more clear. When the courts have to rule in cases interpreting a will, there is the "armchair principle" in England and Wales. It would therefore place itself in the "armchair" of the testator and consider the circumstances that surrounded them when they made their will, to assist arriving at their intention. The wording of a will can also be problematic as words and terms have specific meanings in law, which may be different to their use by the testator in their will. Your intention may not be for the government to benefit, but if there are no family members to inherit and no will, your estate will usually pass to the Crown, ultimately funding the Queen's activities as head of state. 
During the week, police divers were brought in to search the river, and an air support unit was used to assist community policing officers as they conducted inquiries.

He has faced a lot of criticism since saying he would be standing down from the assembly but continuing to lead the party from Westminster as an MP. "We're a democratic party - people are entitled to challenge," he said. "The vast majority of people in the party know that it's essential and they realise that a silly personality contest or beauty contest, for want of a better description, is not going to help the party and it's not going to help the broader politics in Northern Ireland. 
Williamson was badly dropped on 27 by Tillakarate Dilshan at short cover and reached fifty from 60 balls, but he was denied a sixth ODI century when he was run out after finding himself at the same end as Taylor when in pursuit of a second run. Taylor struck sixes in consecutive overs before he was trapped lbw on the toe in the 47th over, but his team compiled the second highest total at the University Oval, to follow the record they set in the previous match.

Mrs May said the convention, which is separate from the EU, "can bind the hands of Parliament". In her first major speech of the referendum campaign, Mrs May said the UK had to "stand tall and lead in Europe" rather than leaving the EU, and that membership made the UK  "more secure from crime and terrorism". She said Mr Cameron "rules nothing out" as he seeks reform of the convention, saying the home secretary had been "setting out a clear distinction between the ECHR and the EU". Regardless of the outcome of the 23 June EU referendum, Mrs May said she still believed the UK should leave the ECHR which she said "adds nothing to our prosperity". It was the ECHR, not the EU, that was responsible for controversial human rights decision affecting the UK, she said. She said the UK had "forgotten how to lead" in Europe and must re-assert itself to force change from within, adding that it could veto Turkey joining the EU. In her speech - and during a question and answer session - Mrs May admitted that being in the EU made it harder to control the "volume of immigration". However, she called for major changes to the way the UK did business in the EU, including reducing the power of the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice. 
GMP said he had gone to Manchester Royal Infirmary and his condition was "serious". 
The 35-year-old, appearing in his first competitive match in six months after injuring his knee, won 7-5 3-6 6-2 6-2. Nishikori, who is attempting to become the first Asian man to win a Grand Slam, secured victory despite receiving medical treatment in the final set. The 14th seed took only 84 minutes to win 6-1 6-2 6-2, despite an eight-minute medical timeout to treat a nosebleed in the first set. Seventh seed Marin Cilic fought back from two sets down to beat world number 278 Jerzy Janowicz 4-6 4-6 6-2 6-2 6-3 in three hours and set up a meeting with Britain's Dan Evans in round two.

The crash happened on Mountain Road near Trimsaran in Carmarthenshire just before 23:20 BST. 
Mr Ralfe told Today the size of the deficit was a "major issue for the takeover". He said he was clear that PSA would not want to take on the pension scheme so they would only buy the operating assets, including the plant and the Vauxhall brand, leaving the pensions with General Motors UK. "The trouble with that is that would then be a company with no assets, so what would have to happen ... is that General Motors US would have to issue a guarantee for that UK company," Mr Ralfe said. 
He added: "However, there is a trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services, and pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the government has had to make to help put the UK's public finances back on track. "Reform of senior civil service pay needs to be fully funded and it needs to happen soon - the current government pay policy is failing and is doing so in a way that costs civil servants and costs the public dear."

"The real solution here is for the RMT to bring this dispute to a close and start to put passengers first," he added. "We are steadily reintroducing trains and will continue to do so until the entire timetable is back in place," he added. He added: "The fact passengers are still paying through the nose for a vastly reduced service is solely due to the gross managerial incompetence and profiteering of this basket-case rail operator.

The government is expected to bring in the changes in an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill, when it is debated in the Commons on Tuesday. It will also raise the maximum sentence for harassment from five to 10 years, and similarly from seven to 14 if it is racially or religiously aggravated. But Labour said its amendment to the bill in the House of Lords in December, which would have doubled maximum sentences for the most serious offences, had been opposed by the government. Mr Chalk introduced a private member's bill last year calling for the maximum sentence to be doubled. Police in England and Wales can now apply to the courts for an order before a stalking suspect has been convicted or even arrested. 
"We look forward to the challenge - it will be a great day with a big atmosphere." 
Asked if the MPs were thinking of defecting, Mr Farron said he did not want to "betray confidences". Mr Farron has called the election of Mr Corbyn a "quite staggering opportunity" for his party to occupy the centre ground in British politics, which he believes is being rapidly vacated by the New Labour leader in favour of a hard left agenda. 
In Jos, three bombs thrown from a car killed 15 people at a bus station and the university. 
Wherever he plays, unless we get him a seat near the posts, he will be targeted, (as) he was against Ireland and Scotland. "If they want to target him, he is good enough and strong enough to deal with that and he should take it as a compliment." But the scrum-half suffered a knock to the head which looks set to rule him out of the region's match against Edinburgh on Friday. 
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been called in to investigate the death and it said a firearm had been recovered. He said he was told by a witness that a police officer had shouted to the man to stop "a couple of times", but the man had not heeded the warning. "I think there's quite a lot of anxiety now in the community, but we should try to stay calm and not rush to judgement," he said. 
After City keeper Marie Hourihan had denied Asisat Oshoala on multiple occasions, the ball deflected straight to Beattie in the Arsenal six-yard box from a Toni Duggan free-kick with 11 minutes remaining and she fired in to win the game. Manchester City and England captain Steph Houghton: "When a chance falls to Jen Beattie, I've got every faith she'll stick it in the back of the net. "I was proud of the girls today, that's as solid as we've been all season but a ricochet on a set-piece falls right to Jen and that's that, it's in the back of the net." 
"The most important attributes of a scrum-half are a fast and accurate pass, as well as a high fitness level and Ali has done well in these areas this season, seizing the opportunity to play for us in some important games." 
Mr Doughty confronted the driver over her use of the phone, at which point she shouted at him, the court heard. Mr Doughty was left with a number of serious injuries, the court was told.

Mr Francis said Sport Wales had "worked hard to get rid" of the board for several months. Mr Francis said Sport Wales said it was in relation to the information given to them by the consultant. He said he had a "difference of opinion" with the consultant, but Sport Wales took the side of the consultant. He said it was not critical of the board's dedication, enthusiasm, and commitment, but added: "We need the right people leading an organisation of this nature if we are going to invest public funds in it."

Derry lie bottom of the league on three points after going down 2-10 to 0-20 to Cork at Celtic Park on Sunday. Down lost 3-15 to 1-13 to Galway at Newry and are on four points, along with Fermanagh, who were trounced by Meath 3-15 to 0-6 at Navan. Cork led 0-10 to 1-6 after a first half which saw play delayed for 15 minutes for treatment to Derry's Jason Rocks. Fermanagh got off to a good start with points from Sean Quigley and Ryan Lyons but it was the home side who assumed control thereafter, enjoying a 2-6 to 0-4 advantage by the interval. Early second-half points from Sean Tobin and Cillian O'Sullivan were followed by a third Meath goal from Tobin, before Lee Cullen recorded Fermanagh's first score of the second half for 3-9 to 0-5.

Laura Whitford decorated the centre of Royston with colourful nets and bunting to publicise a craft fair on Saturday. The nets have been thrown on to a roof and into trees almost every day since she put them up on Sunday night. On Tuesday, the nets were discovered strewn on the pavement and thrown into trees. 
Players sent on loan from Pro12 clubs Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors, along with Scottish rugby academy and national age-grade players, will be based at the Richmond Athletic Ground and will be available to London Scottish for Championship and B&I Cup fixtures. I really appreciate the leadership and vision shown by Scottish Rugby in this exciting initiative and the support they have shown to London Scottish." Scotland back Rory Hughes is currently on loan with London Scottish, while Scottish Rugby Academy players Robbie Fergusson, George Horne and Jack Cosgrove have also been with the Championship club this season. 
A guard of honour by the players and a standing ovation from the crowd marked his final Test, between England and India, at Lord's in 1996. Speaking about the award, Mr Bird told the BBC: "It came as quite a surprise... but I'm tremendously delighted and honoured to get this great honour, this OBE. 
Scott Falconer, 20, Bruce Owens, 19, and Cameron Henry, 17, caused Â£40,000 of damage at the city cemetery between 15 and 17 July 2011. Pictures were circulated and Owens was identified as one of the people in the photographs. 
Mr Robertson has already managed to raise over Â£34,000 for Marie Curie, exceeding an initial target of Â£25,000 which he had hoped to achieve by the end of the journey to the South Pole. After arriving on Antarctica two weeks ago, Mr Robertson was delayed as adverse weather delayed his final departure to the starting point of Hercules Inlet.

"I think it's important to support people who are coming into it," she said of being on the jury. "It's about someone who has the ability to shine on screen, regardless of the quality of the film or the role or regardless of the genre," he said. 
Page was brave in his shot selection and eager to match his opponent's attacking instincts, but was ultimately outclassed as Trump ruthlessly raced to a 4-0 win. After a week in school, Page will travel to Cyprus for the European Championships, where winning the under-21 or senior competition would give him the opportunity to turn professional. Being the parents of a budding player has meant driving him from school to the local snooker hall every day, then for a whole day of practice on Saturdays and usually a tournament on Sundays - of which Page enters about 33 a year. Andrew was the first person Jackson saw as he left the table after his first and second-round wins, and he begins to well up as he reflects on his son's achievement. Even seeing him walk out on the big stage, you get a lump in your throat," says Andrew, his eyes glistening as he struggles to restrain his tears. Perhaps it is a quality he has gleaned from two-time world champion Mark Williams, who is from Cwm - just a couple of miles away from Ebbw Vale - and has been helping Page train. "He's very laid back, which is a good trait to have," Page says. Williams, a former world number one with 18 ranking titles and about £5m in prize money to his name, will be a valuable influence as Page aims to establish himself. The financial rewards for leading snooker players can be great and, this week, Page got a taste of things which might be to come. "He takes on shots that other people turn down because he's excited at that age and to win two matches as he has done is exceptional. "He is a very fast player, he will slow down when he's older, but he is only 15. "He will get a hero's welcome when he returns to the school." 
It has declared a state of emergency in Riau province, where the haze has been building for several weeks and pollution levels are hazardous to health. 
There is no place in the squad for the likes of Graeme Shinnie and Kenny McLean of Aberdeen, who had been strongly tipped to make the cut. He plays players he is up against out the game. "Tom Cairney was the best man on the pitch at St James' Park (a 3-1 win for Fulham), but that was no surprise - he has been the best man on the pitch on many occasions - and Ryan is doing very well at Bournemouth. "He is keeping out some good players, some high-value players at Bournemouth with his ability and work rate and he played very well at the weekend." "Jordan's playing and he scored a couple of goals the other week there - one was a great cross from Barry Bannan," said Strachan. 
"I thought, well, this would be a good year to write an album of love songs," she says. That's a long time to do anything, ain't it? In fact a lot of the songs were written just because of that. I've always been amazed by that myself, how people can just write, year in and year out, about love and it all is different. Do you ever find yourself going, "I don't have time to write a song right now, I need to finish this casserole?" With all my little nieces, it's all "Adele this" and "Adele that!" And I love how she does her make-up, and so I'm always saying to my little nieces, "can you fix my eyes like Adele?" I was just thinking, "This needs to be about a girl dressing up sexy, so she's got to have some make-up, and she's got to paint her eyes". And all of a sudden it's like, "And my eyes like Adele!" You both like to talk to your audience in between songs, but she swears a lot more than youâ€¦ I wondered what you made of that? I think that's just the way we communicate. The song I'm 16 is based on one of your sisters, is that right? Then all of a sudden, in her 60s, she met someone and they fell in love, and it's just like they were born again. and all of a sudden I heard the song in my head. When I was 35, it was a pinnacle, a great time in my life - success and happiness and all that. And so I just decided "I'm gonna claim that number and always be that in my state of mind." I think it's the ultimate cheating song. I saw the turmoil and the heartache, and how overwhelming and overpowering it was. And I just thought, "That's a strong-ass love, right there". The last time I saw you on stage in the UK was at Glastonbury - and you've put that concert on this album as a bonus disc. 
The former Chelsea and Real Madrid assistant manager was in charge of Derby County for eight months before he was sacked by the club in February of 2016. 
The number of children in the city regarded as being at "significant risk" of sexual exploitation has jumped from 12 to 28 between 2012/2013 and 2013/2104, according to the children's charity Barnardo's. The report also points to five court cases in the area in the last three years, including the case in January of a couple jailed for trafficking two Czech women to work as prostitutes. The Black African Women Step Out (Bawso) charity which helps victims of exploitation from ethnic communities, said trafficking has always existed but there is now more awareness from professionals in health and education. She spent a year at the house being made to work as a prostitute and her earnings were confiscated. Police spotted her during a raid at the house and she was placed in foster care before being referred to the anti-trafficking team. Yvonne Rodgers, director of Barnardo's Cymru, said closer work between police, councils and the charity had led to more children identified as being at risk of trafficking, more referrals and more protection for victims. 
Bale's three goals have helped Wales reach the last four of a major tournament for the first time, and he has reiterated his belief that Chris Coleman's men could be crowned champions. As we have said many times, we didn't come here to make up the numbers," he added. "We came here to do a job, we came to do the business. "We have to concentrate everything on the semi. If we can get the job done, then we can look forward to the final." I have had a lot of abuse over the years, when we used to lose and when we were 100th in the world. It is great to be part of and we have loved every moment of it and we will continue to do that."

David Leyonhjelm, a cat-loving former veterinarian and Liberal Democratic senator for New South Wales, has twice been elected to federal parliament, and is one of a disparate group of cross-benchers who hold the balance of power in an unpredictable upper house. He is his libertarian party's sole representative in Canberra, and has been branded "the nastiest, most sexist politician in Australia" by Sydney Morning Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons. I have a fairly low tolerance for idiots," Senator Leyonhjelm told the BBC from his offices in Sydney. "He contacted my office and asked for a comment and one of my staff replied we had no comment for him about the particular matter butâ€¦ said 'well, usually he [the Senator] tells people like that to [profanity]-off, and he didn't in this case, so we're worried that he is mellowing. He can be obscene at times but it is in Australia's more rough and tumble tradition," explained Dr Peter Chen, senior lecturer in the department of government and international relations at the University of Sydney. Senator Leyonhjelm is broadly in favour of immigration, supports same-sex marriage, lower taxes and assisted suicide, but it's restrictions on firearms that make his blood boil. The Liberal Democrats say they have recruited hundreds of disaffected former supporters of the governing Liberal Party and hope to mount a show of force at the next year's state election in Western Australia.

No-one has been charged in connection with the case and the reward is the first to be put up since the investigation began. Police said they had confirmed there was a Volvo 440 in the Ipswich area with a M206 LYE number plate at the time, but it was registered under a false name and address and they are keen to hear from anyone who recognises this number plate so they can confirm whether it was the car in the CCTV images.

Labour commissioned researchers at the House of Commons library to model the effect of a 25% cut on college budgets. Almost three-quarters of the money goes to further education colleges, so if the cut fell proportionally FE colleges would lose £1.173bn and sixth-form colleges £451m overall, say the researchers. According to the calculations this could mean the closure of 80 FE colleges and 56 sixth-form colleges - a total of 136 or 40% of the 335 colleges, says Labour. The government announced area-based reviews of post-16 education and training in the summer, aiming to streamline spending.

Hours later, police killed five terror suspects in a second vehicle attack in the town of Cambrils. Police said the men killed in Cambrils were linked to the Barcelona attack, which the Islamic State group said it had carried out. On Thursday, Mr Trump condemned the attack in Spain before he urged his Twitter followers to look into General John Pershing's actions during the US war in the Philippines in the early 1900s. According to the debunked myth, the US commander rounded up 50 terrorists and ordered his men to shoot 49 of them, using bullets dipped in pig's blood.

The former business secretary said the lack of an alternative to Chancellor George Osborne's Northern Powerhouse was a "huge political mistake". He said Labour did not have election policies to "rebalance both the economy and the political system". "We stepped back and passed the ball to the Conservatives and the coalition," he told BBC's Sunday Politics North West. They ran with it... and it was a strong part of their appeal both in the North West but also nationally. "And the Labour Party, I'm afraid, has a long way to catch up.

As the form of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side hit a new nadir with a 3-1 defeat by Liverpool, social media took great delight in mocking the under-pressure Blues boss. Everton fan Andy tweeted: "Poor Jose, he was just fully committed to being Brendan Rodgers for Halloween, and now he's going to lose his job over it." His adapted lyrics read: "It's the remix to ignition. Paul Hayward, chief sports writer for The Telegraph, tweeted: "Chelsea's players are the best in the business at seeing off managers. 
But he warns that the number of children doping to reach the elite level is Wada's "biggest concern". Howman said Wada's estimation of the level of cheating varied between sports. "The area of most concern for us is the level of young athletes who have not broken through into the elite who are trying to get that breakthrough and are susceptible to taking drugs because that's a shortcut. Asked whether he knew some of the world's top athletes were cheats, Howman said: "Not to the same level as the information we had on Lance Armstrong but certainly we have information that is being investigated about a number of athletes around the world." Howman, who is to step down in 2016 after 12 years at Wada, admitted his organisation's effectiveness was limited by a lack of resources.

The number of assaults average at eight per school day in Wales, which the union said was "a great concern". It said they needed to be considered by schools, councils and the Welsh Government. "I was punched in the face, it was a really violent incident," he said. A spokesman said councils had varying approaches to the reporting of violent incidents and comparing figures from different areas could be misleading. He said the council had been "particularly robust in improving its recording and logging of physical and verbal violence against staff in its schools in order to give a true picture of the situation". "It is clear from these figures that the current arrangements aren't working and that we need a Welsh Government strategy to tackle the roots of these problems once and for all."

The court heard they attempted to evade CCTV cameras on their way back into town, and in the days after they attempted to change their appearance and looked at flights to flee the country. 
Recent hacked emails are "consistent with the methods and motivation of Russia-directed efforts", the Department of Homeland Security said. But a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security said high-ranking officials at the Kremlin were almost certainly involved in the successful attacks. Adam Schiff, a senior member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said he applauded the decision to publicly name Russia as the culprit.

A recent survey suggested that more than a quarter of EU nationals - normally the most loyal and lucrative visitors - would be less likely to holiday here because of the vote to leave. Simon Calder, travel editor of The Independent, said: "It is not unreasonable for people on the continent to feel a bit miffed with the result of the EU vote. "I think a bigger worry, actually, are people who will infer for some reason - maybe all the rhetoric that was going on at the time of the referendum - that somehow they'll need a visa to come to Scotland. The numbers of tourists coming to Scotland's shores is just one side of the coin. "They form a huge part of the workforce in the hotels," he said. 
The LGA, which took on responsibility for public health under the recent NHS shake-up, says exercise prescriptions would encourage people to be more active, lose weight and keep fit. Spokeswoman Izzi Seccombe said: "There are some instances where rather than prescribing a pill, advising on some type of moderate physical activity outdoors could be far more beneficial to the patient. "There are already some good examples where this is being piloted in the UK and it is something we should consider on a nationwide basis."

Mr Hollande issued a partial pardon at the end of January but the courts twice rejected applications for her release. "I've decided to grant Jacqueline Sauvage a pardon of the rest of her sentence. It also secured the backing of President Hollande, who met her three daughters and gave her a partial pardon, which is part of the constitution but used very rarely. His initial pardon in January was for her sentence to be reduced to a minimum, allowing for the judiciary to decide when she should be freed. 
However, he will not withdraw from next month's European Indoor Championships as he did from the World Indoors after last year's disqualification, and is hopeful of earning selection. "If the selectors can have faith, I'm not going to make a decision like I did last year to withdraw from the championships," he said.

These would have formed when comets passed too close to the Sun and broke apart under tidal forces into many pieces, and then splattered the surface of the Solar System's innermost world. And tidally fragmented comets would have done so as a train of objects, having been dislocated in the Sun's immense gravity field. David Rothery and Emma Fegan have been poring over Messenger images, trying to determine how many of the 500 or so crater chains they have identified on Mercury are evidence of this same process of tidal disruption. The chains Rothery and Fegan are attempting to distinguish, on the other hand, have no clear origin. And, intriguingly, when they plot the orientation of these suspect catenae, they appear to betray a bias. 
It cited lootings, property destruction, abductions and killings in territory recaptured from the Islamic State (IS) group. The UN said it was particularly worried about 1,300 Sunnis stranded in "no-man's-land" near Sinjar, between Kurdish security forces and IS.

He stressed the BBC's "uncompromising commitment to accuracy, impartiality, diversity of opinion and the decent treatment of people in the news". 
The musical, which opened on Broadway in 1981 and was filmed in 2006, has taken 35 years to reach the West End. "We now have a fantastic talent pool and will be able to keep it running for years and years because of the talent that is out there." The Lion King opened in 1999 in London and still plays to full houses at the Lyceum Theatre, 17 years on. Riley, who is making her West End debut in the production, said the part of Effie was "the role of a lifetime".

After claiming maximum bowling points, the Bears must do the same with the bat on day two to try and close the gap on leaders Yorkshire, who are already in a strong position in their game against Nottinghamshire. "The Bears have privately accepted for a while that the title was Yorkshire's to lose but, if the Tykes beat Notts, it puts Warwickshire in a strong position to claim the decent prize money for second. "The short boundary in front of the Eric Hollies Stand encourages brisk scoring and Warwickshire will look to push the game forward on the second day." 
This comes despite a sharp decline on the number of people crossing the Mediterranean this year. Smugglers, the UN says, are organising more crossings in very bad weather and staging mass embarkations, in which thousands of people in flimsy boats set off at the same time. An agreement between Turkey and the European Union to halt migrants from travelling to Greek islands has drastically reduced the number of boat arrivals there.

Once in the doldrums, production of the country's cocoa crop has risen sharply, registering a 10-fold increase since 2004. Many of the small farmers, who were previously living on the edge of poverty, have seen a boost to their incomes. But by the late 1990s, the crop was in severe decline, partly because of a crash in the price of the commodity. Farmers lost faith in cocoa as a source of income and one politician even predicted the end of the industry on the islands. Kaoka found that if the farmers could produce cocoa certified as organic, they could improve the price of their crop.

But EU leaders are anxious to avoid sounding like the nationalists who argue that the removal of border controls in the EU left Europeans more at risk from terrorists. The dilemma for the EU is that Schengen - the passport-free area embracing 26 countries - greatly eases the flow of people and goods across the EU, but also requires more information-sharing, to prevent cross-border criminality. There are fears that the international campaign to smash IS, and the Russian bombing in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, will drive even more Syrians to flee abroad. So the 28 leaders in Brussels will look again at the EU's help for Greece and Turkey. Greek coastguards and the EU's Frontex border agency only manage to intercept 20% of the migrants who reach Greek islands after life-threatening voyages, according to Frontex.

"In today's world of persistently low interest rates, it is vital that we do everything possible to enable people to accumulate and earn a return on their savings which can meet their lifetime needs," said Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA. Some investors have been critical of the sector for years, owing to the complicated structure of fees that can include charges for performance and transactions. There was criticism in the report of "actively-managed funds" when a fund manager is paid to research the market. The FCA's solution is to have one easily-comparable charge and make value for money a priority. The FCA found that investors in a passive fund which just tracks the market could earn a 44% higher return over 20 years, because of lower charges. 
The scheme first emerged about seven-and-a-half years ago with the promise of an Â£800m investment and the creation of thousands of jobs. 
He also presented the Queen's letter, in which she wrote: "I am delighted that the long and enduring association between the Australian and British armies will be joined by the military secondment of my grandson, Prince Harry.

A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%. The proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England. Wales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%. Wales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject. There is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years. David Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there. For the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published. It also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales. There were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas. There is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years. More than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. By the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years. In Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North. Meanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts. "One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. Around 4,100 students from Wales were looking for places on results day through the clearing system, which is a lower number than the last five years. A total of 300 students from Wales were given places on the first day, according to Ucas. The university took 1,000 calls last year and was offering "a limited number of places" across 315 courses, with demand expected to be high in science and computing. Joanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said clearing could sometimes be a blessing in disguise to give students a chance to reflect and warned against making rushed decisions.

Meanwhile, George Pilkington has signed a new one-year contract, while David Fitzpatrick has also agreed a deal with the National League club. 
Glasses, bottles and other items were thrown after a pre-season friendly between Grimsby Town and Sheffield United on Saturday. 
Lord Carlile said the payment was wrong as al-Harith was "plainly a terrorist". He said he believed the settlement was paid to avoid disclosure in court of security service activities. The former PM continued: "He was not paid compensation by my government. Lord Blunkett, who was home secretary at the time of al-Harith's release, said he had never campaigned for his return, but "fully accepted that the situation of British citizens held without trial there, was unsustainable and legally and morally indefensible". The government in 2004 had "acted responsibly" he said, adding that "public controversy" at the time had been about whether enough was being done to release detainees "and not the wisdom of providing balanced reassurance". Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary in 2004, said he "never regarded" al-Harith as innocent "and neither Mr Blair nor I ever said that he was innocent". 
He spoke on behalf of the Dallas Police Department, but his words echoed a personal statement he made six years earlier, in the wake of another Dallas police death. Mr Brown took a leave of absence, according to local news reports from the time, and there was speculation that he would resign. But Mr Brown returned to work, determined to improve the Dallas Police Department's relations with the community. He made enemies of the police unions by publicly sacking crooked officers, the Dallas Observer reported. Mr Brown's approach was visible on Thursday, in the hours before the gunman opened fire, as the police department's Twitter account posted pictures of officers posing with protesters and smiling. "Dallas police officers maintain traffic control to ensure the safety of the demonstrators," said another. Speaking to the Observer in February, Mr Brown paid tribute to his officers and acknowledged the risks they took. 
Mr Trump also said Republicans were coming at him "from all sides" and their disloyalty was harder to fight than the Democrats. Mr Ryan is the latest Republican not to back Mr Trump after a 2005 video emerged showing him making obscene comments about groping women. Mr Trump fired back in a string of tweets, saying the "shackles" had been removed, allowing him to "fight for America the way I want to". Reportedly delivered from the confines of his eponymous tower in New York, Mr Trump lashed out at a party establishment that never really wanted him as its nominee and only grudgingly backed him in the hopes that he was a force they could control. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he was "really disturbed" by Mr Trump's comments about women but still planned to support him, saying the election was "about bigger issues than that". Texas Senator and former rival Ted Cruz also said he would still cast his ballot for Mr Trump, telling a Texas TV station that Mrs Clinton was an "absolute disaster". Another rival from the primaries, Senator Marco Rubio, said he would also back Mr Trump. 
The 25-year-old, with the help of his 'Will-bombs' fans, explains how the scheme - which runs sessions across the UK - can help "make you an incredible player". 
Some of the 150 protesters who gathered held photos of those they said had been imprisoned for their political views. "After a long wait and rumours of an impending release of prisoners of conscience in Syria, our hopes have vanished," said a statement from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The organisation - which groups together the families of 21 jailed human rights activists - had said it planned to demonstrate in front of the ministry on Wednesday. The interior ministry denied that the initial protest was political in nature. He said that there was no chance of political upheaval, and pledged to press on with a package of reforms. 
But obviously he was asked to play a different role by Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat because of their circumstances and he did a brilliant job for the team. But knowing him like I do, if he is asked to do any kind of job for his team to help them stay in the Premier League then he will always give it his all. Defoe has pace and thrives on being put through too of course, but one of the reasons he has scored as many goals as he has done in his career is that there are so many different elements to his game. But I know that it will not have knocked his confidence because he is the sort of player that never loses faith in himself, and for good reason. That bit of class he produced against Newcastle was the kind of moment of brilliance I have come to expect from him after playing with and against him down the years. 
Researchers plotted the distance between state schools in England against the proportion of pupils achieving five good GCSEs. But even a slight increase in the distance between schools saw a sharp drop in grades for poorer pupils, according to the study. However, the average attainment of free school meals students was not lowest in the most geographically isolated schools - more than 15km from their nearest neighbours, according to the researchers, although it was still poorer than in the most highly populated areas. 
Smith and Danny Brough swapped drop-goals before Smith landed a second one-pointer and Dan Sarginson's score sent the Warriors to the summit. The final 10 minutes became a drop-goal contest between half-backs Smith and Brough, and Wigan forged a crucial one-point lead before England international Sarginson raced over in the dying seconds to clinch a thrilling victory. 
One of the organisers, Richard Lusimbo, told the AFP news agency: "For us, this is a celebration of who we are." 
But the spending cuts and tax rises have undermined the economic recovery in Spain. The country is back in recession and its banks are severely under-capitalised given the collapse in the Spanish property market. 
The abuse was said to have been carried out at locations across southern England and London in the 1970s and 1980s. In a statement, the IPCC said: "There is no evidence to indicate bad faith, malice or dishonesty and no indication any of the officers may have behaved in a manner which would justify disciplinary proceedings. But the watchdog said there was an indication that the DCI and two other detectives may have failed to accurately present all relevant information to a district judge when applying for search warrants for three properties. IPCC commissioner Carl Gumsley said: "The allegation that incomplete information may have been provided to a district judge when applying for search warrants is serious and the IPCC will thoroughly investigate this matter." 
In a statement her family said they were "heartbroken at the loss" of their "loving daughter". Her family said: "We are truly saddened, heartbroken and still in complete shock that we have lost a beautiful and caring soul. 
He said he found a laceration in the wall of the child's right atrium which would have caused his "rapid death". He described Liam's broken bone injuries as "quite severe" and said the large amount of bleeding in the muscle around the leg fracture could have contributed to his death. He stressed that heart injury was the most likely cause of Liam's death but said he could not rule out that it had been caused during CPR. Dr French said the child had a low body weight for his age, in the bottom 4% of the population according to medical charts. He also said Liam appeared thin, with the muscles in his arms and legs less than he would expect to see in someone of his age. 
The oil company rejected this, saying the ship was delivering fuel to industrial facilities there and the authorities had been kept informed. The military spokesman, Colonel Ahmed Mesmari, said the tanker had been targeted because it had failed to submit to an inspection before entering the port. It said the vessel was attacked before it could enter the port to unload its cargo. It said it remained neutral in the conflict in Libya and the incident would hinder its ability to maintain supplies within the local market. 
Over the last few months some 13,000 Munduruku have been protesting against government plans to build a series of hydroelectric dams that will flood part of their land on the upper reaches of the Tapajos river. Now the new frontier for Brazil's hydropower expansion has moved to the Tapajos River - a huge tributary to the Amazon that lies further to the west. Adrian Barnett, a British biologist working in the area, says that - even by the high standards of the Amazon basin - the Tapajos is an area of extreme biological richness. The government plans to award the contracts for the first of these dams, Sao Luiz do Tapajos, later this year. The authorities are adamant that they need to tap into the huge hydropower potential of the Amazon if Brazil is to have the energy to fuel its ambitious development programme. Claudio Salles, director of the Acende Brasil energy think tank, says that of the 19,000 additional megawatts the government plans to have by 2021, 16,000 will be generated in the Amazon. "And it is precisely the production of primary goods that needs a lot of energy and generates few jobs." 
"Messages from her mum will have to be positive but she will also have to allow [Kajsa] to persevere herself. "One of the key aspects will be motivation. Her reason of wanting to motivate other people to exercise and this sense of purpose will be really important. "The notion of self-talk, what she is going to say to herself throughout the challenge, will be important. "This personal link of wanting to motivate other people to exercise will give her a sense of purpose and might help drive her on especially during difficult moments of the challenge." 
In Seville, some people jumped off bridge to swim in the city's Guadalquivir river to try and escape the heat, according to AFP. The heatwave is expected to spread, prompting concern in France and in the UK. The high temperatures are expected to last at least until the end of the week. Chemical processes start to be affected, the cells inside the body deteriorate and there is a risk of multiple organ failure. 
The reported failure of the talks is a big blow for Yahoo, which has been seeking to restructure its operations in a bid to boost its flagging fortunes. "Installing the hand-picked choices of the current board does nothing to allay investor fears that Yahoo is poised to repeat the errors of its past,'' Mr Loeb wrote in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. "We have received constructive suggestions from several of our major shareholders and, therefore, it is especially disappointing that Mr. Loeb has chosen a potentially disruptive path, just as the company is moving forward under new leadership to aggressively increase the value of Yahoo,'' the firm said in a statement. 
The trunk road drops from 150m (492ft) to 20m (65ft) as it enters a valley at the Berriedale Braes. 
More than half of the 40 UK police forces that responded to a Freedom of Information request from the programme reported delays of at least three months. Cases were "waiting to be allocated" to a member of staff in the hi-tech crime unit for analysis. When her mother Amy alerted the police, she was astonished to be told it would take six months before forensic examination of her daughter's laptop and phone could begin. The family eventually waited 10 months for police to examine the evidence, but the case was dropped after they said Louise's phone no longer worked. Families of children who had been abused online said the failure by police to launch a full and immediate investigation into every case had left paedophiles free to continue their abuse. Karen Bradley, minister for preventing abuse and exploitation, said the government was "committed to ensuring police have the resources they need, and have prioritised child sexual abuse as a national threat". 
The road is near a bonfire in the New Lodge and it is understood a number of petrol bombs were thrown on the road. On Monday, shortly after material was taken away from a bonfire in the Markets, a number of parked cars were set on fire and petrol bombs, stones and other missiles were thrown at police. Later that evening, trouble spread to other areas and a disused credit union building was set on fire in west Belfast. Belfast City Council staff have also been targeted and on Tuesday, the council confirmed that one of its workers had been injured when a stone was thrown at a council vehicle. It also confirmed that some street cleansing and commercial waste collections were restricted in the Markets, New Lodge and Divis areas on Tuesday. Community centres in the New Lodge, Divis and Markets areas closed to the public at 17:00 BST. In a statement about Monday's attacks, the PSNI said officers had dealt with "localised disorder caused by a small group of people" - some as young as 12 - in the Markets, New Lodge and North Queen Street areas. Meanwhile, a bonfire has been rebuilt close to the New Lodge flats, on Queen Street in north Belfast, despite weeks of efforts to remove pallets and other bonfire material from the neighbourhood.

"With Cookie still in the job, I know what he said, but he could change his mind and carry on. So I think it's unfair to comment on that," he says. "But he's done a great job, got some talented players there at the moment and I think the focus with Wales at the moment will be just winning those next four games and getting to the World Cup." "Teams are very much a shadow of the manager and I think this Welsh team is, knowing Chris as well I do, because he is larger than life, he is a great character, a great person to be around, but also a serious football man." But the success and all-consuming nature of his playing career means he is happy to spend some time away from the sport's firing line. I've just completed my first year without football and it's been good," he says. "I think the pressure you put yourself under, be it as a player or a coach, that pressure's sort of come off. "I'm exactly where I was last summer, more or less got the next six months planned but, with the chance if a club does come in and want to talk, then I can do that." "It's brilliant I can step out because I was two years as a coach, you're constantly putting yourself under pressure, you're always thinking how you can improve the team, so to step away from it and be a bit more relaxed, you can look at things in a different way. 
Fifteen people, including the bombers, died and more than 35 were injured in the attacks at a mosque and house of vigilante leader, they said. Our correspondent says the attacks in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, come as the military says it is winning the war against Boko Haram. In June, the military's headquarters were moved to the city as President Buhari wanted to centralise operations against the militants. 
He made his Black Cats debut in last season's FA Cup defeat by League One side Bradford City. 
The descriptions of the grey smog that's hung over the city get more and more extreme: "Airmageddon", the "Airpocalypse". On Tuesday, 103 factories were ordered to shut down, and a third of government cars ordered off the roads to combat what was already being described as the worst January smog since 1954. The difficult bit is how to change the path China is on. On the plus side, then, there is a growing realisation things have to change, and the media are now being allowed to debate the issue. On the minus side, that "control target" still means China's energy use will continue to expand, and, crucially, so will the burning of coal. And as if to prove that changing China's habits will be hard, there is another worry on the immediate horizon. But the office in charge of Beijing's firework industry has said that residents can set off fireworks during the Spring Festival holiday according to the regulations, but that the office hopes residents will refrain from doing so, the China Daily reported. 
Despite their differences over Brexit and the legacy of the Troubles, the DUP and Sinn Féin maintained remarkable discipline after first the UUP, then the SDLP decided to leave the executive. For different reasons, both the DUP and Sinn Féin are keen on widening the battleground. Should the mandatory coalition, whereby all the major parties have a right to be in government, be abandoned in favour of a more conventional voluntary coalition? It seems hard to imagine that the DUP and Sinn Féin won't emerge again as the main players. Could a shift in opinion, for example, endanger the DUP's power to veto measures without requiring the assistance of other parties, for which 30 MLAs are required? 
"We need to inform women that everyone is unique and that variation in appearance is normal in the vast majority of cases," she said. The RCOG paper recommends that women should be offered counselling and psychological treatment for problems such as "body image distress". The paper says: "Education, support and advice should be at the heart of clinical practice, with a sympathetic appreciation of female body insecurities." In another paper, published by the British Society for Paediatric and Adolescent Gynaecology (BritSPAG), clinicians are advised to inform girls under 18 that labiaplasty surgery before puberty is complete can lead to long-term problems. The paper also recommends that girls showing signs of psychological problems should be referred to a paediatric clinical psychologist. He also said he had seen the number of patients requesting labiaplasty increase dramatically in the past few years. 
And that, to be sure, is exactly what the attackers in Zaventem airport and the Brussels subway meant to do. But the next task is to avoid having the wedge that the terrorist exploded into our society be driven deeper and steadier by angry citizens. The work that lies in front of us is wide-ranging, but it should involve us all. It is easier to formulate the mission than to execute it, but we know that we cannot move forward without starting, immediately, by building a consensus around that mission, in order to make the reaction to these attacks inclusive instead of divisive. The first priority of our governments - and we have lots of them in little Belgium - is to guarantee an effective security for all citizens, with all the resources that takes. The unity we need embraces disagreement, because the society we need and want to defend is democratic, pluralistic and diverse. We might understand today that ugly prejudices seep through the fissures that the attacks created in the social fabric, but tomorrow people of all persuasions and inspirations should join hands to mend both the fissures and the prejudices. We urgently need new scaffolding to repair the bombed bridges and to reconstruct a (better) way of living together. That is what Belgium, and the whole world, needs. 
The station said attempts to catch the culprit had so far failed and some listeners had complained "their children have started humming the song". He said: "We have had calls from people who have found it hilarious, while some have raised their concerns, including our competitors, and a lot of people in the industry are aghast at how difficult it is to stop these people. "The first time we reported it to the police, but they said they would have to catch him in the act.

The program, designed to make voting easier for disabled residents, is part of a five-county pilot in the north-western state. The pilot program is intended to replace older tools designed for accessible voting in Oregon, often laptops with modifications that were stored in two suitcases. Apple donated five iPads for the scheme, and the state spent about $75,000 (Â£46,700) to develop the necessary software. 
Waiting times, the inability to make an appointment, as well as drug and alcohol problems are some of the factors which prevent people from accessing health services, the report said. "We know that around 30% of people who are homeless saw their health get worse in the past 12 months and that many of them face barriers to accessing a range of health services that could have prevented that deterioration from happening." A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We continue to work closely with Public Health Wales, health boards, local authorities and homelessness organisations to ensure appropriate services are planned and delivered to meet the health needs of homeless people and those at risk of homelessness."

Campaigners have said that provisions for protecting net neutrality in the existing text of the rules are too vague and many worry that it will be easy for internet firms to strike deals with content providers which may not be advantageous for everyone. It is thought that many MEPs would have been reluctant to begin a process of amending the regulation given that it might have delayed another aspect of the rules - the abolition of mobile data roaming charges. There was also the issue of how laws in the Netherlands, Slovenia and Finland - which all have special net neutrality protections in place - would be affected. Michael Theurer, a liberal German MEP described the outcome as "regrettable" and added that he felt the regulations as passed do not include a clear definition of net neutrality to inform regulators. Prior to the vote, the inventor of the world wide web Sir Tim Berners-Lee and a host of tech companies had expressed their support for the amendments and urged MEPs to vote them through. The idea that data should be ferried from place to place as quickly as possible, regardless of what it is, is how most people assume the internet works. "As the text currently stands there is no indication as to how much abuse of dominance would be permissible under this arrangement," he told the BBC. And a string of tech companies signed a letter to the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, asking MEPs to adopt the amendments. 
Astronomers working on the Gaia space telescope have released a first tranche of data recording the position and brightness of over a billion stars. Its goal was to update and extend the work of a previous satellite from the 1980s/90s called Hipparcos. It mapped the precise position, brightness, distance and proper motion (that sideways movement on the sky) of 100,000 stars. Gaia's imperative - To work out how far it is to the nearest stars It is a function of the leap in technology, of course. This angle is equivalent to the size of a euro coin on the Moon as seen from Earth. By studying the way Gaia's stars appear to wobble on the sky, it should be possible to infer the gravitational presence of orbiting worlds. "Gaia is going to be extremely useful for exoplanets, and especially systems that have the Jupiter kind of planets," said Esa's Gaia project scientist, Timo Prusti. If this measurement is combined with the stars' proper motion, it will lay bare the dynamics of the Milky Way. At the outset of the mission, scientists had hoped to get radial velocity data on about 150 million stars. The longer the mission runs, they believe, the closer Gaia will get to its target of 150 million radial velocity measurements - and that movie. 
The company, at the heart of Japan's industrial development for decades, is still recovering from revelations in 2015 that profits were overstated for seven years. That accounting scandal led to the resignation of the company's chief executive. In a statement on Thursday, Toshiba said it was still assessing the scale of the writedown. 
In a three-minute exchange with reporters in Warsaw, Mr Trump aired a wide range of his usual grievances - against the US media, his presidential predecessor and the US intelligence community. That's a lot of time he did nothing about it." Mr Trump is referencing a line in that same Washington Post article, from a senior Obama official who felt the US government didn't do enough to punish Russia for what appeared to be a brazen attempt to destabilise the US election. There's a certain amount of irony that Mr Trump would highlight this anonymous remark, given how frequently he and his aides have condemned reliance on anonymous sources in news stories critical of his own administration. Trump: "He thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Anthony: The Washington Post article reported that Mr Obama decided not to go public with the evidence of Russian involvement because of concerns that it might provoke further Russian action, reveal US intelligence-gathering resources or be cited by Mr Trump as evidence that Democrats were "rigging" the US election against him, an accusation he was regularly making in the closing days of the presidential campaign It's a charge that is impossible to prove, of course - but it allows Mr Trump once again to bask in the unexpected nature of his presidential triumph. Mr Trump brings this up because of New York Times and Associated press reports that all 17 agencies had signed off on the conclusion that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US election. Anthony: It seems like it wouldn't take too much "heavy research" for the administration to discover the findings of its own intelligence apparatus, but the president is correct that the New York Times and Associated Press have corrected their initial reports. Anthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme. At the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation. Anthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network. Such an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own "leverage" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T. 
One of the nations that pulled out was Bermuda. They remember discussions on the island about boycotting, but no decision was made and the athletes made their way to Scotland. However, the Bermuda Olympic Association (BOA) - the governing body of the team - was still considering what to do. According to team manager John Morbey, this was one of the reasons given behind the team's eventual withdrawal. "The night before the opening ceremony, a teammate and I caught a taxi and we went to a disco," recalls Trott, who was looking forward to his first Commonwealth Games having competed in the 1984 Olympics. Trott and Ruberry woke up on 24 July, the day of the opening ceremony, with no idea what was going on. By the time he had reached the pool, Ruberry knew it was all in vain. Adventurer Mark Beaumont reports on the Queen's Baton Relay as it makes its way to 70 nations and territories of the Commonwealth. He returned to the pool for the 1988 Olympics, and now works as a swimming coach on the island. 
Her lawyer in the US, Harland Braun, has said that Ms Del Castillo is prepared to talk to the authorities "if we receive proper information and credentials". On Wednesday, Ms Del Castillo sought an injunction in Mexico to prevent her arrest. Ms Del Castillo and Guzman exchanged dozens of messages before she and Sean Penn met him in northern Mexico. She would have been involved in money laundering if she had received money from Guzman for her business, explained Ms Gomez. 
Firefighters said five vehicles were involved in the incident, with the casualties taken to hospital. 
And this weekend he could have no bigger stage to prove it, as Barcelona travel to Real Madrid for the first Clasico of the season. Same song, different name and, although he obviously did not mean it in this way, the goal felt like a symbolic moment with Neymar delivering an emphatic message to the watching world: 'Forget Messi. Neymar's electrifying performances over the past few weeks have attracted considerable attention in Spain and Albert Masnou, the deputy editor of Barcelona-based newspaper Sport, believes he is playing better than Ronaldo. Now he is capable of leading the team when Messi's not there, and we are seeing his full potential." It's nice to see a Brazilian continuing to make history and I think he can be the greatest in the world." Messi is, quite simply, the man around whom the Catalans have built their team, and when he is on the pitch the primary function of the other 10 players is to service him. Others - and there is perhaps no better example than Neymar - have accepted that role and made the most out of playing for Messi first, the team second and themselves third. "Neymar has been the king for two months but he knows that when Messi is there, the leader is Messi." Neymar is widely regarded in Barcelona as the heir apparent: the player lined up to become the team's focal point when Messi has retired or entered into decline. 
UK doctors have said there is no accepted cure and Charlie should be allowed to die with dignity. The judge will analyse medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division as Charlie's parents seek to keep him on life support at London's Great Ormond Street hospital. He was admitted to Great Ormond Street in October after developing aspiration pneumonia and was diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome - a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness. "We continue to support them in every way we can, while advocating, what we believe, is best for Charlie." 
That fell slightly short of the first episode of series two, which launched in 2015 to 7.6 million. The debut episode of the first series, shown in 2013, pulled in 6.8 million. 
The letter concluded by asking for confirmation from Network Rail and the Environment Agency that a solution  "acceptable to the region as a whole" to stop flooding at Cowley Bridge was found as soon as possible. Mr Gallop said Network Rail fully recognised the importance of rail services to the South West economy and a looking for a solution was a priority. 
It is inevitable that over the coming months, April's stamp duty changes will take a little of the heat out of the investor market. Other surveys have suggested a pick-up in activity by landlords ahead of the stamp duty rises, but there is some disagreement among commentators over what effect this is having on the UK housing market as a whole. Lloyds is the biggest mortgage lender in the UK with 20% of the market and, like the Nationwide, uses its own home loan data. A survey is of house prices in Scotland is published by the Registers of Scotland, using a simple average of house prices. Housing market sentiment is reflected in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) survey of some of its members. 
He has operated a vast drug empire that has a fleet of trucks, aeroplanes and submarines, as he told Penn in the interview, conducted while Guzman was still in hiding. Actor Penn has been secretive about the circumstances around the interview, which was conducted while Guzman was being pursued by Mexican and American authorities, and how he managed to secure it in the first place. But if Mr Penn had helped Guzman in some way to avoid capture - or interfered with the authorities' efforts to find him - he could be prosecuted. Caleb Mason, a former federal prosecutor who used to work on drug-smuggling cases, said Mr Penn was unlikely to be prosecuted in Mexico, either.

The five men from London died in the sea at the East Sussex resort of Camber Sands in August. 
I think it's going to be a real difficult task because to win three games on the bounce is tough. "We've got Cambridge coming up who fancy getting into the play-offs, Carlisle on Saturday, and even down to the likes of Luton - there's going to be some tough games coming up for everybody." 
In the final 10 minutes both sides were awarded penalties with Ellis Harrison netting for Rovers and Paul Mullin for Morecambe, the visitors moving to 12th. 
It was a supreme defensive display from the Toffees, who had been the better attacking side in the first half. Before the break, the home side looked sluggish and were outworked by a dynamic away side. "Everyone in the stadium could see it was a penalty - it was so near to the referee and so clear," said the Chilean. "We have been on the back end of receiving a penalty, in the last seconds against Stoke," said the Spaniard. In the first half, the Toffees were patient and precise when they had the ball and hard-working when they did not. After the break, Roberto Martinez's side were firmly on the back foot and spent long spells without the ball but demonstrated discipline and commitment to limit City to only a few goalscoring chances. 
Judge Monica Gomez Ferrer, who is hearing the evidence relating to Falcao, is also overseeing the case of 32-year-old Portugal captain Ronaldo, and is scheduled to question him on 31 July over allegations he illegally evaded 14.7m euros (£13m) in taxes. Coentrao, the 29-year-old Portugal international, is accused of having hidden close to 1.3m euros (£1.15m) from the tax authorities. 
Mr Hedges said he was "shocked to the core" to witness the conditions in large parts of the UK.

Even in male-dominated areas such as IT and engineering, women are proportionally more likely to succeed once they decide to apply, the survey found. But in the field of law the reverse is true - 63% of students are female but only 58% of the graduate scheme posts go to women. Graduate employers are making efforts to boost the numbers of women they hire, the research found. 
Conteh played for Guinean side Ashanti Golden Boys de Siguiri and had received several call-ups to Sierra Leone's squad but was yet to secure a place in the international side's first team. "Conteh was not impressive in the last day of training because something was wrong with him," Sierra Leone's coach John Keister told BBC Sport. I always liked him because he was humble and always good to be around the Leone Stars team. God knows best but this is so scary after a month when I was with you in the Leone Stars camp." "He was a talented goalkeeper and it is a great loss for Sierra Leone.

It's just a case of 'we've got to get ourselves back in that top division'. "Liverpool became a bit of a fortress for us in 2011 but having the home comforts of the new stadium, which is a fantastic facility and a lovely place to be, has probably really helped to settle the side. "They've started to create the same feeling that we had at Liverpool in 2011, in that it becomes a difficult place to play. It was a big moment for the club because an awful lot of work had been done to get to that stage. "Simon is probably  The times I've seen him, he's looked very fluent and has scored a great volume of runs. "I got the chance to play with Ashwell and I know what a determined performer he is. You'll very rarely put them into a situation that they've not played out before, so they can play lots of different roles and also complement the other guys in the team." With a trio of bowlers claiming more than 50 wickets apiece and runs coming from throughout the team, Lancashire are worthy of promotion in 2013." The important thing for him is to keep his body in a good shape so that he can go out and demonstrate those skills. "I've done it myself - if you can bat a long time, see off the new ball and bat out that first session, you're setting a platform for the team to get big runs. 
"They are not in a great position, that is an obvious thing for me to say. Wright admits it would be "disappointing" for Saints to lose one of their Tayside rivals out of the league. "Rangers or Hibs would probably be an automatic replacement but everybody wants to see the top clubs in the league on merit." "I'm sure they are wanting them down just to get the bragging rights in the city. "The atmosphere in the games is brilliant for players and it makes you more determined and you want to win them. 
What they wanted to see, he says, was whether Iran was ready to seriously engage and, if that happened, there might be another round of talks in four to six weeks time. The P5+1 hope eventually to persuade Iran to reduce its enrichment of uranium and fully open up its nuclear facilities to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Since then, the IAEA expressed concern that Iran had failed to co-operate with its inspectors and had carried out activities "relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would never allow Israelis to "live in the shadow of annihilation", and hinted his country is ready to strike Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomacy does not work soon. 
Stephen Port was charged with four counts of murder last year but the new allegations relate to eight living complainants. Some of the charges relate to the deaths of: 
The plane crashed in the French Alps on March 24 with 150 people on board. On 26 March, French investigators said information from the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) found at the crash zone revealed that Mr Lubitz had taken over the controls of the plane and sent it into a dive intentionally. 
The Old Trafford club failed to qualify for Europe's premier club competition last season but its return to Champions League competition has seen a big leap in matchday and broadcast revenues. During the quarter, the club also brought the management of its Old Trafford Megastore in-house and signed a licensing deal with South Korean footwear brand Sbenu. There was a negative impact from the sales of players Angel Di Maria, Robin van Persie and Nani, which was partly offset by the profit made on the sale of Javier Hernandez. 
Mr Tsipras pledged new jobs and a rise in the minimum wage. But Greece's creditors have made it clear they will not support a bailout for the country unless there is a comprehensive plan to reduce spending and increase revenues. In the interview, Mr Barroso pointed out that there were poorer countries lending money to Greece who would not support the idea of Greece's debts being written off. "It was not Germany or any other member of the EU that created the problems in Greece - the problems in Greece are structural: low productivity and previous governments." Nations such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain had come back from the financial brink and Mr Barroso said Greece could do the same: "There is nothing regarding Greece that prevents it being successful, but... bad politics have created a lot of problems for Greece." 
Organisers passed a motion on Saturday not to invite Malcolm Turnbull, who was the first sitting prime minister to attend the last gay pride event. Mr Turnbull, a supporter of marriage equality, backed his party's calls to allow a national vote on the issue. Cat Rose, who put forward the motion at the Mardi Gras parade's annual general meeting, accused Mr Turnbull of using last year's event as a "media opportunity".

According to Cancer Research UK, black women are less likely than white women to go for a mammogram when invited by the NHS. Heather Nelson, who works for BME Cancer Voice, said: "Women, especially women of colour, are less likely to go for screening. Lumps are not the only sign of possible breast cancer. The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47-73.

The 32-year-old midfielder had trained alone or with the club's under-23s since Jose Mourinho was appointed United boss in the summer. He was named in United's Premier League squad for this season, but left out of their Europa League squad. With Ander Herrera banned, Schweinsteiger is an option for United's Premier League trip to Swansea. 
Radovan Krejcir was arrested on Friday at his home in Johannesburg on a charge of kidnap and assault. Police are accused of taking him to an open field where he was "allegedly shocked with a taser and a plastic bag was placed over his head to suffocate him", Ipid said in a statement. The High Court in Johannesburg ordered that Krejcir be transferred to hospital after his doctor testified that his injuries were consistent with those of someone who had been assaulted. In his ruling, Judge Ramarumo Monama said the doctor was a credible witness. 
"I've had years of great pride in which I have given my body and soul," he said. 
The victim's solicitor said the payout was believed to be one of the biggest by a British force in a privacy case. In a witness statement, the woman, who agreed to an out-of-court settlement, said she "felt betrayed by GMP". The claimant has to establish they have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information concerned, and that privacy has been breached. The media can argue the claimant's right to privacy is outweighed by the right to freedom of expression and that there is a public interest in publishing. She can't put the genie back in the bottle and it's something that she is going to have to live with for the rest of her life". 
She made amends for that poor display with a personal best 22.79 secs in the 200m, which pulled her closer to Canada's world silver medallist Theisen-Eaton. And despite a poor display in the shot, her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson will take heart that she achieved her best heptathlon score of 6682 points in Gotzis two years ago, when her total after the opening day was also 3923. The long jump, javelin and 800m remain on Sunday but fellow Brit Morgan Lake - adrift of her personal bests in all four events on the first day - is likely to fall short of the total needed for Rio.

A ceremony, attended by PM Shinzo Abe, was held at Hiroshima's memorial park before thousands of lanterns are released on the city's Motoyasu river. But it claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people in the city. In Hiroshima a bell tolled at 08:15 local time - when the US aircraft dropped the bomb that flattened the city centre. Later in the day, thousands of paper lanterns will be released on the city's Motoyasu River - symbolising the journey to the afterlife of those who died. 
The company formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute of Waste Management and homelessness service StreetLink to raise awareness of the issue of people sleeping in bins. The organisations carried out research last year that showed that 28 of the 176 waste management organisations surveyed reported finding people sheltering in bins over the previous 12 months. 
At the hearing in Pretoria, Judge Thokozile Masipa said the petition had no reasonable prospect of success. 
The path, which is carved into black basalt cliffs, was an engineering triumph - it's connected by a network of walkways and bridges - the most iconic of which was the tubular bridge. Post-war austerity spelt decline for the 1.5 mile walkway and it was closed to the public in the 1950s. While health and safety is more of a concern nowadays some things have not changed, including the steep walk down to the starting point - a hole through rock known as Wise's eye. Before starting the Gobbins experience, visitors are given a safety briefing and a hard hat in the visitors centre, it's then on to a minibus for the two-mile journey to the path. This attraction has created some much needed employment in the area and one of the tour guides is Robert Stewart, a local farmer who has decided to try something new. "It is something that you could bring visitors from anywhere in the world to and be very proud of the quality of the tourism offering," he said. 
It leaves them 12 points adrift at the bottom of the table, with a maximum of 10 points on offer from their final two matches. Wasps were far from at their best, on the back foot for much of the game, but have restored their five-point lead at the top and need one win from their last two to secure a home semi-final in the play-offs. "We have the infrastructure at Ashton Gate to be a Premiership team - we're not going to be next year, but hopefully the supporters will still watch us in that league. "It was a similar story to a lot of games - we've created an awful lot, we've been in the opposition 22 many times but we've just not executed and got across the line. "We give Wasps an opportunity and they score tries, it's as simple as that - that's the difference in the level we need to get to. "We were down and beaten in the second half but we played right until the very end of the game - I expect that from them in the next two games." 
About half of Italians do not want the country to take in more people, pollster Renato Mannheimer told Reuters news agency. Italy is accommodating rising numbers of migrants because countries to the north have tightened their borders and some EU states have refused to take part in a plan to relocate 160,000 people from Italy and Greece. An estimated 40% of the migrants in Italy have a valid claim to asylum or leave to remain on humanitarian grounds, AFP news agency reported.

Research from the Institute for Policy Studies found that in 2014, bonuses paid to Wall Street employees had been double the annual pay earned by all Americans who worked full-time at the federal minimum wage. For example, the bonuses in the UK finance and insurance sector were shared between more than a million employees - considerably more than on Wall Street. They would no longer be earning minimum wage, so the total amount paid to workers on the minimum wage would fall considerably and as a result the amount paid out in bonuses would be a higher multiple of it. 
The Scottish government said the welfare of officers and support staff was taken "very seriously". The shortages are affecting the health of officers and civilian staff and these new figures are a huge concern. The changes that the SNP forced through are stretching the mental health of officers and civilian staff to breaking point. The spokesman added: "They have a number of targeted activities to support wellbeing and occupational health across the organisation. 
Current Yes keyboardist Geoff Downes tweeted: "Utterly devastated beyond words to have to report the sad news of the passing of my dear friend, bandmate and inspiration Chris Squire." "It's with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire," a statement on the band's official Facebook page said. Squire, who was born in Kingsbury, north-west London, was the only member of the group to feature on every studio album. John Petrucci, founding member and guitarist for American progressive metal band Dream Theater, tweeted: "Thank you for all of the amazing music Chris Squire. 
"Whether you are a kit man, doctor or secretary on the bench you have to understand the game. After Oscar's opener, Andre Ayew equalised on his Swansea debut but the visitors only held on for 95 seconds before Federico Fernandez scored an unfortunate own goal to gift Chelsea a 2-1 lead. "In one minute, it was a penalty, red card and the goal. "If you have 10 men and are winning you can defend well and try to find a strategy but to play with 10 men and try to win the game is more difficult. 
One of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called "Uncle Niu". English names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market. "What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand," says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services. Western companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning. Others will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand. The sound is 'bao ma', starting with a B and M. Plus, it's short.

Japan, who left Kingsholm to a standing ovation after a lap of honour, host the competition in four years' time and will go into that tournament buoyed by an excellent World Cup on English soil. Japan are the first non-tier-one team to win three matches at a single Rugby World Cup. Full-back Ayumu Goromaru is the first player to score more than 50 points in a single RWC campaign for Japan. Eric Fry became the seventh player to get a yellow card for the USA in a RWC match.

In a statement released through their lawyer Aamer Anwar, the Mahmood family said they were "full of horror and anger that their daughter may have had a role to play in the recruitment of these young girls to Isis". They also sent a message to Aqsa: "You are a disgrace to your family and the people of Scotland, your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam. They also said she was brought up "with love and affection in a happy home" and appealed for her to come home. 
Eight Type 26 frigates are due to be built on the Clyde, but the UK government has not announced a timescale for the project. Mr O'Hara told MPs: "It would be an unforgivable betrayal of the Clyde workers if they were the ones that had to pay the price of Brexit, but also the price of Trident." "We are negotiating a deal that aims to optimise the requirements of the Royal Navy in terms of the capability the ships will deliver, to achieve value for money for defence and the taxpayer, and to deliver a build schedule that drives performance. 
Earlier on Saturday, two people were taken to hospital following a crash at the same junction between a vehicle towing a horsebox and a motorbike. 
"The National is an extraordinary place full of extraordinary people and I look forward with relish to the task ahead," Norris said. Sir Nicholas will have spent 12 years as the National Theatre's director when he hands over to Norris in 2015. He said his successor would be "welcomed with great excitement both within the National and in the theatre at large". He added: "His work as a director is always searching, deeply considered and adventurous and I have no doubt he will bring these qualities to the running of the National." Norris said his new role was "a great privilege and I will attack that with gusto", adding he would like to "cast the net wider" in terms of who would perform at the theatre. He is the first former actor as well as non-Oxbridge graduate to be appointed since Sir Laurence Olivier, who was the National's first artistic director in 1963. He is an exciting choice, someone who will build on the National Theatre's present reputation as one of the most admired and innovative performing arts organisations in the world. When asked by the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz whether he thought his acting past would also bring a different flavour to the institution, Norris laughed: "It's an interesting question and one I had not anticipated at all, because to compare me as an actor with Laurence Olivier is one of the funniest things I've heard in a long time." Nick Starr, the theatre's executive director since 2002, also announced he would be leaving the NT during 2014, leading to a phased handover of the top jobs. 
"If we were to build a ship this size, new at the moment, we'd be looking around £25m-£30m," said Mr Payne, secretary of the Liverpool and North Wales Steam Ship Company.

To make up the shortfall, he set up a scholarship fund that would take young bright Africans to the US and Canada. Barack Obama Senior was the first African student to study at the University of Hawaii. We stood in the family's small graveyard, next to the grave of Barack Obama Senior. He was minister of economic development and planning but the motive for his killing remains a mystery. As a sign of his global significance he had appeared on the cover of Time magazine, the first Kenyan to have done so. She replied in a quiet, confident voice: "My father could not have known that by helping one person to go to school, he was going to change the lives of so many people. "Barack Obama has achieved a lot personally and it's great that he is the president of the United States. Mr Obama Senior, who also graduated from Harvard, returned to Kenya in 1968 and eventually worked for the government as an economist. 
The teenagers allege that before returning to Tehran from the Umra, or lesser Islamic pilgrimage, in March they were abused by security officials at Jeddah airport. On Saturday, hundreds of people protested outside the Saudi embassy in Tehran and demanded that the Iranian government "end the unnecessary Umra". 
Meanwhile, Iraq's army continued an offensive to retake the northern city of Tikrit from the Isis-led rebels. In a separate development, Israel called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to the gain made by the Sunni rebels in Iraq. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) announced the establishment of the caliphate in an audio recording posted on the internet on Sunday. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group said, would become the leader of the state and would be known as "Caliph Ibrahim". The international community, including neighbouring Turkey and the US, remains opposed to the breakup of Iraq. 
But after my first professional fight, when I got booed, I thought to myself: 'Right, this ain't all glitz and glamour. Pro boxing's not just a sport, it's a business - the hardest business in the world." But three years into his paid career he was all but washed up and never fought for a pro title. And still does, it's just that he momentarily lost it along the way. "In the end it was so easy for me as an amateur," says Gavin, who missed out on the 2008 Olympics after failing to make the weight but remains the only British boxer to win a world amateur title. "I won my last 50 fights, everything was done for me at GB Boxing in Sheffield and when you're part of a team you can help each other. "I took my family up to Manchester and it was all right for a bit," says the 28-year-old. "But when I split up from my girlfriend I was doing it all on my own. "I remember almost falling over in front of one trainer," says Gavin, "and he said: 'I'm glad you didn't go over, that might have been my investment gone, my 10%.' "I was on the brink of giving it all up. It's a hard enough game without all that so you need to know you've got the right people around you. "I got complacent because it all seemed too easy again, starting out in the pro ranks," says Gavin. "During the build-up I was a bit too vocal, telling him he was ugly and his breath smelt. "I read and hear people saying I'm flash and cocky and it does hurt a bit. But the people who know me realise I'm a genuine, humble, down-to-earth boy." I love boxing, but it's hard, it's a short career and I want to get paid as much as I can and get out with my faculties intact.

Le Fondre, 29, signed from Reading on a three-year deal in May 2014 but has scored only three goals in 23 league appearances for the club. "All I can say is we are looking to add a couple of new faces and to add to the group. 
Mr Haigh has been accused of fraud by the Dubai-based group and is currently in custody while authorities decide whether to pursue a criminal case. A GFH Capital spokesman said: "GFH cannot and will not comment on such general allegations, and is concerned about Mr Haigh's protestations of being unable to engage with the claim against him while apparently being able to brief the media at will." The allegations were contained in a dossier compiled by Mr Haigh "about GFH's professional conduct and practices", according to a statement released on his behalf by UK-based spokesman Ian Monk. Mr Haigh told the BBC he underwent stomach surgery in the UK before flying to Dubai and remains in lots of pain and unable to eat solid foods. 
The MoD said it did not recognise figures in the report and it "ignores the benefits" for young people. Using figures presented to Parliament in 2011, the report said it cost an "estimated" £88,985 to recruit, train and pay new soldiers aged 16 and 17, compared with £42,818 for each adult recruit. But it added that under-18s who completed their training were likely to serve for an average of 10 years, compared with seven-and-a-half years for adult recruits. "I had a brilliant time, it's a good thing for young people to do and I was the youngest of my intake."

Three-time Olympic eventing medallist Fox-Pitt, 47, has been named in a 12-strong Team GB equestrian squad for this summer's Games. "I've come off a lot of times in my life, and in being knocked out my memory has been very selective and I've been able to put it behind me." He said the fall "affected my sight, my judgement and made me more dozy, in the beginning it was all a little bit of a dream". Another gold medallist in London, Ben Maher, joins Skelton in the jumping team along with Los Angeles 1984 silver medallist John Whitaker, who will be competing in his sixth Games. Fox-Pitt is joined in the eventing team by three Olympic debutants in Kitty King, Izzy Taylor and Gemma Tattersall. 
The inquiry team expects to view hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation relating to the scheme. It was set up to investigate the design and operation of the scheme, which at one point had a projected overspend of £490m. The inquiry will consider the delay in implementing cost controls in 2015 and allegations of political pressure to keep the scheme open at a time when applications were flooding in and the projected costs were spiralling. Mrs Foster was the minister in charge of the former Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment, which ran the scheme.

The British and Pakistani authorities have in the past expressed concerns that any arrest of Altaf Hussain could lead to violent protests in Karachi. For many years now, Altaf Hussain's MQM has had a bloc of about 20 members in the National Assembly, making him a powerful figure both in Pakistan's biggest city Karachi and in the country as a whole. As well as his solid electoral base in Karachi, Mr Hussain has a powerful party organisation in the city which is often accused of extorting money from businesses and using violence - or the threat of it - to get its way. One is looking into the question of whether in his televised speeches he has incited violence in Pakistan, charges Mr Hussain denies. The MQM is often accused of extorting money from businesses in Karachi and shipping the money to the UK, charges the party also denies. 
The skeleton belongs to a small, plant-eating dinosaur which lived 200 million years ago - at the beginning of the Jurassic Period. The analysis was carried out at the ESRF facility in Grenoble, France, and showed that the specimen was juvenile. 
BBC Online and the BBC News website launched in 1997, leaving a permanent public daily record of the news output. The process has begun in recent years with a permanent collection of Desert Island Discs and the archive collections for channels, such as BBC Four, made available to the public. The Journal of Record plans to publish a television and radio news bulletin from every day of the BBC's history, in the form of daily news broadcasts and scripts, together with the live coverage of key events.

"Technically speaking, however you want to look at it, this was all my doing and I take full responsibility," said the singer, who recalled being high on drugs at the time. "If I'm walking around and I'm very modestly dressed and I'm keeping to myself and someone attacks me, then I'd say that's his fault. But if I'm being very lairy and putting it about and being provocative, then you are enticing someone who's already unhinged - don't do that. But her comments were condemned by the charity Victim Support who said that victims "should not blame themselves". "People criticising Chrissie Hynde for her comments are overlooking that she is a victim and this is self blame. While the Guardian's Hadley Freeman echoed her thoughts: "Many people seem furious with Chrissie Hynde, and I get why, but I feel pity for her. 
Mark Allison has already run across across the USA and Australia, and is now taking on the 3,400 miles from Lisbon to Istanbul. 
The magistrates hearing for Ms Riley, 22, whose address was given as West Cotton Close in Northampton, has yet to be arranged. 
The judge said there was no alternative to custody. 
There have been concerns for years that using talcum powder, particularly on the genitals, may increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The mineral talc in its natural form does contain asbestos and does cause cancer. It has been linked to a cancer risk in some studies, but there are concerns that the research may be biased as the studies often rely on people remembering how much talc they used years ago. Also, there does not seem to be a "dose-response" for talc, unlike with known carcinogens like tobacco where the more you smoke, the greater the risk of lung cancer. The charity Ovacome says there is no definitive evidence and that the worst-case scenario is that using talc increases the risk of cancer by a third. Lawyers accuse J&J of failing to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer - a claim J&J denies. 
Motorists have been told to avoid the area and traffic is being diverted onto the A48M at junction 29. 
They will be put on display in a similar way to the Bristol Zoo gorilla trail - which raised Â£427,000 for the zoo's gorilla conservation projects and Wallace and Gromit's Grand Appeal Mr Park said: "Gromit is quite well-loved and the children's hospital is very close to people's hearts in Bristol and beyond. 
In his message, PUP leader Billy Hutchinson said the party was "born out of a determination of loyalist leaders in Long Kesh to move away from the futility of conflict". But the deputy leader said he was concerned smaller parties would suffer most in a shrinking Stormont. 
Social worker Stephen Lorimer, giving evidence at the inquiry, said that the boy had been in a stable, happy placement with the foster couple who were caring for him. But the couple handed in their notice after a member of their own family became very ill, and the boy was moved to stay with Mr and Mrs McKenzie instead. Mr Lorimer also told the inquiry about an incident where the boy punched a brick wall because he was not getting his own way. 
"Indiscriminate use of force" was used by the police in the run-up to the Olympic Games in August, according to one of the organisations. "We call upon the IOC to put in place all measures necessary to avoid repeating the same pattern of violations we have seen in Rio," said Florence. The IOC cited a "number of instances" relating to the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, where allegations were followed up with the local authorities.

Dr Hopkins said patients in hospital currently receive support to cope with any existing addictions and the same help would be offered to smokers. She said they would be given support from the health board's smoking cessation service and smokers could be prescribed with nicotine replacement patches to help them cope during their stay. 
Tensions in the country are high following the government's decision to ban India's Daughter, a film about the 2012 gang rape of a student. India's rape crisis has been pushed back to the forefront of public discourse by the decision of the government to ban the BBC documentary India's Daughter, which examines the 2012 gang rape of a young student in Delhi. 
Andrew Wright flew 268kg (591lbs) of the drug from Germany to the UK in eight trips in his light aircraft. Having returned to the UK, Williams, 38, would collect the drugs from Wright and deliver them to gang leader, Mark Dowling, 43, in Essex. Border control officers smashed the racket in November 2014 when they found four bricks of cocaine in the boot of Wright's Porsche Cayenne and a further 30 hidden in the tail section of his plane. 
The Italian, 26, scored 15 goals in the French Ligue 1 last season as Nice finished third to reach the qualifying rounds of the Champions League. 
But the firm behind the label is now at the centre of a dispute with President Robert Mugabe's own party, Zanu-PF, as the country heads towards Saturday's referendum on a new constitution and elections expected in July. The party wants to make money from what it sees as a profitable scheme and Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa is trying to patent the R G Mugabe signature. Away from Zanu-PF events though, it is hard to find anywhere to buy the products as the company does not have an official outlet, although it says it is moving soon to a shop in central Harare. Its most recent accessory is a cap with 1924 - the year of Mr Mugabe's birth - imprinted on it, which was released in time for the president's birthday celebrations last month. "Yedu Nesu has the sole rights to market, distribute and manufacture the brand… the Robert Mugabe regalia," he said. Metropolitan hubs are the heartlands for the Movement for Democratic Change, whose leader Morgan Tsvangirai is set to challenge Mr Mugabe once more in this year's presidential election. Mr Tsvangirai's spokesman Luke Tamborinyoka told the BBC that: "The Mugabe fashion craze is a desperate attempt by his brand managers to catch the young voters. The House of Gushungo team says their business is driven by a desire to ensure Mr Mugabe's legacy, not by avarice. 
A club statement read: "Mark and the directors all agreed it would be in the interests of all parties to part company." 
"We started working together at the beginning of this year, and it's been a great year for me so far," added Hatton, who has risen a further 13 places to 55th in the world rankings. I'm going to enjoy a week off to get ready for a return to the States. "I got a lot of confidence from last week and I took it into the Open and it's great that I now don't have to try and qualify again (following his Top 10 finish) for Royal Birkdale next year." "I holed a really good par putt on the eighth after pulling it left into the bunker. Then I holed a really good par putt again on nine, and that sort of just kept the momentum going. 
The judge said it was a "terribly sad and tragic case". The Old Bailey heard he was diagnosed with a depressive condition and Asperger's syndrome in 2010. The court heard he picked up a champagne bottle and hit his sister, saying he "had to do it". 
The 31-year-old, who began his career at Celtic, joined Everton from Spartak Moscow in January 2014 and subsequently played 41 games, scoring once. 
During her successful libel case, the author said the newspaper's story was "premised on a false picture" of an article she had written 10 days earlier for single parents' charity Gingerbread. The statement concluded the newspaper allegations left the author "understandably distressed" but she was now happy to bring her libel proceedings to a close. 
Paul Tunney, the team's senior officer, said: "It's like a giant game of hide and seek but there's no-one to tell us if we're getting warmer. Working vessels are hostile environments and with it brings the risk of danger to rummagers. They have to climb in and inspect tanks, crawl into the vessel's inner structure or scale the hull walls of the cargo holds. "When we're on a vessel it is working, it is discharging and loading cargo so there are lots of things on the move," said Mr Tunney. "If we're going into a tank, we have to check the atmosphere of the tank and go in wearing breathing apparatus. Mr Tunney said: "Often we find people involved in smuggling are going on diving holidays thinking they can learn to dive and then collect drugs attached to the hull of vessels over here. 
Apart from matches held at Wembley and Twickenham, no game in the two decades of Premiership rugby has been watched by more people - and, whether old or new Wasps fans, there was plenty to warm the soul on a cold winter's day in Coventry. Shane Geraghty converted that, while Tom Homer added three penalties to keep the visitors' arrears to 18-16 at the break - but it was pretty much one-way traffic in the second half. Daly ran in on the left for try number three but it was not until the final minute that Wasps claimed their bonus point when Italy international Masi went over in the left corner. And, although the first half was pretty turgid, we've got the job done in the end." "We knew what to expect and we made a decent fist of it, but we're disappointed with the blow-out at the back end. "I don't want to take anything away from Wasps, as this was their day, but we have a frustrated group of players in the dressing room. The penalty count was 10-2 at half-time and you have to hope it levels out, but it didn't. 
The BBC's Umaru Fofana in Banjul said that thousands of people had tried to force their way into the airport to see Mr Barrow return and they burst into celebration as soon as his plane touched down. President Barrow was driven from the airport in a convoy of cars and waved to the crowds who lined the route. Mr Barrow was sworn in as president at the Gambian embassy in Senegal a week ago, but a public inauguration on home soil is planned soon, aides say. The new president has asked for the force to remain in The Gambia for six months. Mr Jammeh, who was a 29-year-old army lieutenant when he came to power in a 1994 coup, had refused to accept the results of the December election. 
The agreement includes a $100m fine and $370m in consumer relief to borrowers. 
The British team of Becky and Ellie Downie, Claudia Fragapane, Gabby Jupp and Ruby Harrold were within touching distance of Russia after the first apparatus, with the younger Downie sister Ellie posting a fine 15.1 on bars. Russia won the gold medal with 175.212, and France were third on 168.496. 
But Bristol hit back and Rob Hawkins' score helped them earn a fourth losing bonus point of the season so far. The hosts also saw Jason Woodward shown a yellow card after the break, before they battled back after Tigers went down to 14 themselves as Lachlan McCaffrey was penalised for a defensive infringement. "I'm delighted with they way we finished the game, to have the character to go back up the field and win a penalty to get a losing bonus point. "Obviously it's not the result we wanted, we wanted a win, but we've got to take a point away from this game and be happy." 
The woman said he used a key-ring sized black monkey to signal whose turn it was to make tea and coffee. I was shocked and offended to see a black monkey on my desk. "He was jeering [at] me and harassing me about the black monkey...

The Blaenau Gwent food bank runs from a church in Ebbw Vale twice a week and was the first to open in Wales in October 2008. This is about 200 fewer people than the same period last year but compares to 900 in April to September 2012. "And we continue to spend Â£94bn a year on working age benefits to ensure there is a strong safety net in place." 
Mr Goldsmith lost his seat last year after resigning and calling a by-election in protest at the decision to expand Heathrow Airport . 
There has been growing concern about the damaging impact of sugar on health - from the state of people's teeth to type 2 diabetes and obesity. In its Food for Thought report, the BMA warns that a 330ml can of pop is likely to contain up to nine teaspoons of sugar that are simply "empty calories". "The biggest problem is a lot of us are unaware of the amount of sugar we are consuming on a day-to-day basis." She added: "There is no silver bullet but we do want to see industry go further to cut the amount of sugar in food and drinks so that people can make healthier choices." 
Among those crowding into the stadium that day was schoolboy Peter King, who was destined to play for Worcester and later, at the highest level, for Cardiff City. "The game couldn't be played on the Saturday as the pitch was waterlogged as per usual, so they played in the midweek and we all had time off school to go to watch it. "After the final whistle blows on Saturday I will leave with a lump in my throat, but also with hope in my heart that the fans will continue to support the club through their Aggborough exile and work together to bring them back to the city of Worcester soon. "As a lifelong City fan who grew up in the shadow of St George's Lane, spending the last few years commentating on every match for BBC Hereford & Worcester has been a pleasure and a privilege. "When Bill Jones had gone down to Cardiff he had taken Harry Knowles with him, but Harry was in his twenties by then and maybe it was a bit late for him to make the grade. Like all who have played for, watched and reported on Worcester City, however, it is St George's Lane that will be uppermost in their thoughts this weekend. 
They are remarkably similar to those of the Hobbit find in 2004 and are thought to belong to the ancestors of floresiensis. According to Dr Yousuke Kaifu, from Tokyo's National Museum of Nature and Science, the discovery of the tiny 700,000 year old hobbit ancestor suggests that erectus might have shrunk within the space of just 300,000 years, which is a remarkably short period in evolutionary terms. He added: "It is just as likely that the ancestors of (The Hobbit) came from somewhere like Sulawesi, to the North, and we have no evidence so far of who might have been there more than a million years ago." The researchers acknowledge that their argument is based on scant data: one fragment of a jawbone and a handful of teeth. That involves finding the fossils that date back to before a million years ago and which go with the stone tools." Dr van den Bergh added that the discovery of Hobbit-like humans living on Flores 700,000 years ago ruled out the possibility that the discovery in 2004 was of a group of modern humans who had been stunted by illness. 
The court heard she wanted to live under strict Sharia law and believed such a regime could only be found where IS imposed control. The judge said: "Raqqa is, and was in October 2015, the epicentre of a war zone. Further, it was, and presently remains, under the control of IS.

Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." 
Those living close to the Uruguay River in Entre Rios province are reported to be among the worst affected. The provinces of Formosa, Chaco and Santa Fe are also reported to be badly affected. 
Joseph Tsang, 31, from Oxford, was convicted in his absence last month at the city's crown court of two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault.

Mr Wigan, who is also a patron of the Â£189m library, said the works were borne from his "fantasy world". 
The mother of a Salford student killed by a man posing as a taxi driver said it was "clearly wrong" to give licences to sex offenders. However, councils are free to decide who they consider to be "fit and proper" drivers, and can take into account the date of the offence, the circumstances, and the applicant's behaviour since. "People just see the word taxi and think that's a legal vehicle to get into. She said it was "clearly wrong" for drivers with sexual convictions to be granted licences. Steve McNamara, general secretary of the LTDA, said: "These drivers clearly fail to meet the fit and proper person test and should never have been in a position to transport members of the public. Five of the six councils who granted licences to convicted drivers defended their procedures and said a wide range of checking systems were in place. 
BBC Scotland understands officers have taken an interest in issues that arose through Glasgow City Council's internal investigation and that the local authority would be willing to co-operate with police. It is also understood that a meeting took place recently between the council and police and that some of the issues spoken about involved people outside the council. The other is the partner of an executive with Mears who is now working in a different role at the council. The broader issue of openness and transparency within Glasgow City Council is set to be a key theme in the campaign ahead of May's local elections. However, the SNP believe that, in general, the council could do more to ensure it is transparent and seen to be so. 
Mr Williams told the BBC he initially thought he had caught a dolphin and it took two anglers more than 25 minutes to land the fish off Soroya, Norway. He said: "Two of the guides on the fishing trip helped lift it into the boat and it took 25 minutes." As well as being the biggest cod landed by a British angler, it is the biggest for a disabled angler - Mr Williams has a heart condition. 
Mr Kyle said: "Can the prime minister assure the people of Brighton and Hove, who have a long history of dealing with terrorism, that should another terrorist attack happen the local force can cope without calling on neighbouring forces?" 
Loach uses I, Daniel Blake to expose the welfare system in the UK, and says he wants the film "to break audience's hearts, but also to make them angry". Loach, a social campaigner for most of his career, believes the current criteria for claiming benefits in the UK is "a Kafka-esque, Catch 22 situation designed to frustrate and humiliate the claimant to such an extent that they drop out of the system and stop pursuing their right to ask for support if necessary". It's done to get the numbers down and the most vulnerable in our society are suffering as a result." And this was one of the first people we encountered." "Food banks have been praised by the state without any sense of shame at all and yet it's appalling in 2016 that people are having to make the choice between food and heating, which is common. "It's deeply shocking that this is happening at the heart of our world." 
The music icon's estate has struck deals to make his albums available by streaming, and is planning a series of releases including a remastered Purple Rain album, two albums of unreleased tracks, and two concert films. 
The 43-year-old, who looked out of sorts against Maguire in a one-sided World Championship quarter-final, said he made the decision three months ago. He said: "There's a few reasons - the schedule, the fact I'm not playing the snooker I want to play, and the fact I'm not enjoying practice. "I was delighted to have made a maximum here [against Stuart Bingham in the first round] which is why I was more animated when I achieved it. Hendry, who was making his 27th consecutive appearance at the World Championship, looked back to his fluent best as he hit his third Crucible maximum - a record he shares with Ronnie O'Sullivan - in his first round victory over Bingham. "He's always put snooker first, been a model professional, a credit to the game and I'll see him in the legends tour this year for more battles. I don't think he's made the right decision to bow out. Former world champion Terry Griffiths, who once coached Hendry, added: "I thought he should have retired a while ago but he had the belief that he could continue. After dominating the 1990s, Hendry's form started to tail off and he reached just one World Championship final in the next decade. His last ranking tournament final was in the 2006 UK Championship where he lost to Peter Ebdon. 
Police say the man - said to be a former employee - entered the Ludlow restaurant in the Southbank area late on Sunday evening brandishing a knife. 
The kidnapping was the second abduction of a GIZ aid worker this year. 
Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. For journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. First, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the "dozvil" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a "control point for entry and exit". "Come with me, please," he says, "I'd like to have a chat." What is the nearest Metro station to your home? Then the official escorts me back to the van. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Simferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the "Ukraine". And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge. "Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union," declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. "All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet," he promises in another. Near our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: "Crimea belongs to all of us". As far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine. The inscription reads: "To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea." This is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. Many of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. Out on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as "a return to the Soviet Union. Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union." But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need." I am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. "In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine," Nadia tells me. "I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea." "Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans," retorts Nadia. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth." "I read it in the internet," she replies. We drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle. "I've written to everyone asking for help," Umer tells me, "from the bottom levels right up to the president. In the Black Sea resort of Yalta I find the promenade packed with people enjoying a seaside stroll in the sunshine. From the conversations, there is an overriding sense of a population desperate for peace. "Crimea is not just a thing to be given to one country or another. 
The trust said it is required to safeguard the area and had offered Mr Pike advice about moving on. Mr Pike, who spent a night in a police cell and received a fine, said the hut had since been destroyed. Steve Marsh from the Woodland Trust said the organisation had sympathy for Mr Pike's situation and the eviction was "not personal".

Militants led by the jihadist Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) took over parts of the cities of Falluja and Ramadi in late December. In the absence of appropriate medical care due to the army's blockade of the area, skin diseases and viral and bacterial infections are spreading uncontrollably. "With the conflict in Anbar continuing UN agencies continue to receive reports of civilian casualties and sustained hardship in communities impacted by the fighting and the influx of internally displaced persons," said UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming.

A "large amount of feathers" and a discarded seed bag, believed to have been used to move the birds, was found nearby. 
This means none of the president's supporters will go to the ICC. Mr Gbagbo's trial in The Hague, in the Netherlands, started in January and is likely to last three to four years. But pro-Ouattara forces were also accused of similar atrocities and these have not been prosecuted in the ICC.

Haydn Hollis (Notts County) right footed shot from the centre of the box is saved in the centre of the goal. Stanley Aborah (Notts County) right footed shot from outside the box is saved in the centre of the goal. 
"The next thing I remember I was in the ambulance and a paramedic was on the phone to my missus," he said. A road traffic collision investigator said the junction at the approach to the Ballyconnelly Road was clearly marked with signs and road markings. "The Fiat was required to stop by the road markings and signage," he said. Assessing the conclusions of the expert's report, the coroner said: "The bottom line is the car failed to stop at the junction and very tragically that led to a collision with the tractor and the deaths of the driver and passenger." 
The new spacecraft will be known as the Inmarsat-6 series. They will update services currently offered in the L-band part of the radio spectrum. The telecoms company is the world's biggest player in its field, and so the Airbus workers in Portsmouth and Stevenage will see the contract as a tremendous endorsement of their skills and expertise. This higher frequency part of the radio spectrum is where much of the new sector growth will occur - such as in-flight connections for aeroplanes. 
"The club have been good for me and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time in Wales." Parnell played in Glamorgan's T20 defeat to Surrey on Friday, a third successive loss for the Welsh county which is another significant blow to their hopes of qualifying for the quarter-finals. Despite their recent poor T20 displays, Parnell has been encouraged by what he has seen from Glamorgan in the shortened form of the game. 
He said: "I am absolutely thrilled, and slightly surprised, to be the new rector of the University of Dundee. "In fact Dundee was the starting point for my first ever adventure at the age of 12, to cycle across Scotland. 
But it stressed that "very significant socioeconomic inequalities" remained which were "unfair, unsustainable and detrimental to Scotland", and said the country had a moral and economic duty to tackle the issue The report said it had been suggested that admitting students from deprived backgrounds with lower grades could have a detrimental impact on the academic excellence of Scotland's universities. It added: "This means that equal access is capable of transmitting the social and economic benefits of higher education between generations, breaking cycles of deprivation and contributing to a society that is healthier, wealthier and fairer. "The evidence shows that a higher education is a passport to a better life. 
Over the past year, the Scottish economy grew by 0.7% - a third of the UK rate of 2.1%. The report indicated that growth in Scottish GDP over the past year was driven by growth in the services industry, particularly in business services and finance. It was estimated that the closure resulted in a reduction of Scottish GDP of about 0.2 percentage points in the second quarter. 
By 2012, the loss of primary forest every year in Indonesia was estimated to be higher than that in Brazil, said scientists. The researchers, from the University of Maryland, said that deforestation had led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a loss of biodiversity. A government moratorium on deforestation was signed in 2011 and was intended to slow down the pace of deforestation. 
He gifted an opportunity and it is another one to put in the list of failures. "He looks in two minds at the crease, unsure whether to go for the full-on aggressive shot or a checked drive." Joe Root edged a delivery fractionally short of De Kock behind the stumps as the occasional ball misbehaved but England's two leading batsmen put on 60 to take them to the close without further loss. Having reprieved centurions Stephen Cook and Hashim Amla with dropped catches on day one, England were guilty of further errors in the field as South Africa pressed on to a commanding first innings total. In only the third over of the day De Kock scythed James Anderson to gully where a diving Ben Stokes could not grasp the chance. 
Former party leader Mark Durkan, who has been the MP for the area since 2005, lost out by just 169 votes to Elisha McCallion of Sinn Féin. "Mark has been a public representative in Derry for a large number of years and he has served it well," she said. Mr Durkan said one of the reasons for his defeat was greater campaign funding by Sinn Féin. "Mark was without a doubt one of the finest speakers in the House of Commons, he was also the inventor of these incredible 'Durkanisms'," Mr Pound told BBC Radio Foyle. 
John Yates, from English Heritage, said a list of historic buildings had been revised to show how potential developers could adapt the Grade II listed building. 
The firm's lead lawyer Phil Shiner said that the case "raises a number of very troubling systemic issues about the practices and techniques used on Iraqis". In January 2014 PIL submitted a legal bid with the International Criminal Court to prosecute British politicians and senior military figures, for alleged war crimes in Iraq - a move which the then Foreign Secretary William Hague said should be rejected. "The closure of PIL shows that we are making progress on that, tackling these types of firms head on to make sure we get the right outcome for our armed forces who show such bravery in the most difficult of circumstances." The spokesman also said ministers were considering a "suite of measures" to prevent firms making bogus claims, including strengthening the penalties for abusers of the system. 
Oldham Council said it investigated the claims made in December but concluded, in a report leaked to the Sunday Times, it had "no concerns" about any schools.

In Carmarthenshire, Conwy and Monmouthshire, the overall residential care budget, which includes provision for respite, has been cut. The figures show Swansea Council has cut its internal provision respite budget for older people and younger adults by over 80% in the last two years. The council has decided to transfer money from respite care into its own residential homes, who will provide short breaks in the future. According to the charity Carers Wales, respite provision is already in short supply, but the cuts being made by local authorities will limit support even further. The Welsh Government said it recognised "the important role that respite care has in supporting individuals and families at what can be an extremely difficult time". "It is a matter for local authorities to ensure they have necessary respite placements."

Mr Wildstein, who worked at the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, said he and his boss, Bill Baroni, told Mr Christie that Mark Sokolich, the mayor of Fort Lee, was "frustrated" over the lane closures. Mr Wildstein testified on Tuesday against Mr Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, the governor's former deputy chief of staff. Federal prosecutors opened an investigation and indicted three members of Mr Christie's aides in 2015, alleging that two of the key bridge's three lanes were closed in retaliation over Mayor Soklich's refusal to endorse the governor in his re-election bid. The governor was not charged in connection to the scheme and has denied any involvement. But last week, federal prosecutors alleged that the governor was informed of the plot, using Mr Wildstein's testimony to argue their claim. Mr Wildstein's testimony follows last month's revelations that former Christie ally Christina Renna allegedly texted her colleague, Peter Sheridan, about the governor's knowledge of the plot. 
Okay, this is putting it a bit strongly, but the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has said that there is some "mild innuendo" in the film. But turning Paddington from a chilly bear in to a polar bear isn't the board's only concern. The Australian actress plays the film's villain and she's out to "kill and stuff" Paddington. "There is also a short scene in a jungle when Paddington and his family run for shelter during an earthquake with trees falling around them," according to the BBFC. Contrary to other reports, the BBFC has told Newsbeat that Paddington was always classified as a PG film and has not been upgraded from a "U" certificate.

The inquest heard that the car was slightly over the speed limit as it was travelling at 108km/h (67mph) in a 100km/h zone. Flashing lights signalled that the bridge was about to be raised with the middle section of the road lifted horizontally, the inquest heard. Mr Tarry drove down a verge past stationary queuing traffic and through the first set of barriers, about 120m from the bridge, the court heard. The car then travelled in a "controlled manner" at between 70 and 90km/h down the centre of the road. The court heard that the three band members sitting in the back of the car were not wearing seatbelts but those in the front were, and had to be cut from the vehicle. 
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he had accepted a recommendation from the Low Pay Commission that the minimum wage should increase by 3%. Meanwhile, the man who set up the minimum wage 15 years ago, said it is in need of major reform. "The sooner we move to a living wage, the better," he said. In January this year, Chancellor George Osborne said he backed the idea of the national minimum wage reaching £7 an hour by October 2015. The latest announcement could pave the way for that to happen, but it would need a rise of more than 7% next year to do so. 
But with the lowest turnout in the constituency's history and a margin of 2,620 the narrowest ever recorded in this once proud Labour heartland, can this declaration really be believed? "The people of Stoke seemed to think he [Paul Nuttall] didn't come from the area and they didn't believe his pack of lies. "It's a relief UKIP didn't get in but [Labour retaining the seat] just means things are going to stay the same." They backed Mr Snell in the by-election and also voted to stay in the European Union. "I think the people of Stoke do care about politics and they want to make things better," she said. "I think they were misled by UKIP in the beginning. "The turnout seemed to be very low and I think a lot of people think it was a foregone conclusion. But although Labour enjoyed a heyday in the 1960s and 70s, their share of the vote has consistently fallen over the years down to a record low of 37% in this by-election. Tom Wilson, 26, voted for UKIP in the by-election and said he was "very upset" at the result. "I think only UKIP would have made a change for the people of Stoke." Now Mr Snell is the town's new MP, the challenge is on for him to win back the trust of former Labour supporters and engage with new ones. Lee Woolrich, 33, from Stoke-on-Trent, is head of client services for a digital agency but did not vote in the by-election. Mr Woolrich believes politicians need to take more of an interest in Stoke-on-Trent - he too feels the place has been forgotten and is badly represented by the media. "I love the developments in Hanley and the cultural quarter. "On a local level, I like the direction things are going in but I don't necessarily think government in London will listen to the people of Stoke. 
"The results didn't really show what he was doing and how good he was but it was nice to give him that positive feeling on Wednesday night." "He has put a lot of effort into the other games as well, he has really helped us and for us to give him that first league win was crucial. If a new manager has until the end of the season to work with the players and then to kick on next season it would be great for the club." 
The Trending Topics column appears in the top right corner of a typical Facebook page. Facebook's Mr Stocky explained: "Popular topics are first surfaced by an algorithm, then audited by review team members to confirm that the topics are in fact trending news in the real world and not, for example, similar-sounding topics or misnomers." The Gizmodo story, which quoted a person it said they had been one of the editors, alleged Facebook staff were routinely tampering with Trending Topic stories. Breitbart, one of the leading conservative news sources in the US, said the reports confirmed what they had "long suspected", that "Facebook's trending news artificially mutes conservatives and amplifies progressives".

In response, the BBC, Sky News, ITV and Channel 4 said they "remain committed" to staging debates before the poll on 7 May. Raising the issue in Parliament, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had argued back in 2010 that it would be "feeble" for any party leader to walk away from the debates but was now threatening to do just that. He said he was keen to defend his record during the campaign, suggesting he would support the idea of two debates, one a head-to-head encounter between him and Mr Miliband and another in which all "national parties" were represented. In identical letters to Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband, Mr Clegg and Mr Farage called for a repeat of the 2010 debates - the first ever leaders' TV debates in a British election - and insisted they "not the property of the politicians". But Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she backed Mr Cameron's stance and said it was in the interest of the three other leaders to help persuade broadcasters that her party should be included in one of the debates. John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said that having "nailed his colours to the mast" over the Green Party's participation, it would be difficult for Mr Cameron to shun the debates if they were invited. While the debates were a "good test of political leadership", Prof Curtice told the BBC that they had dominated the campaign and "not necessarily succeeded in reaching out to more marginal voters". In a statement, the four broadcasters said: "The debates played an important role in informing millions of our viewers in 2010 and we will continue to work with all the parties to ensure that they happen again in 2015".

Scotland v Republic of Ireland (TBC, 7 July) 
The Scottish government said it was committed to "protecting and increasing the NHS budget". The papers were passed to the BBC and The Herald by a senior NHS whistleblower, who said they had become frustrated by the argument of the "Yes" campaign that the biggest threat to the NHS comes from the UK government. The documents conclude that the "status quo in terms of service and workforce planning is not an option". But it also points out that boards are "without the mandate and authority to implement the scale of change and redesign required". "We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that's why we've already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year.

Tens of thousands of civilians are also believed to be in the rebel enclave. Rebels have now lost more than 90% of the territory they once held in eastern Aleppo since government forces stepped up their offensive to regain full control of the city a month ago. For much of the past four years it has been divided roughly in two, with the government controlling the western half and rebels the east. The Syrian Observatory says that at least 415 civilians and 364 rebel fighters have been killed in rebel-held areas since 15 November. Russia and the United States, which backs the rebels, held talks in Geneva over the weekend to discuss a deal for civilians and rebel fighters to leave Aleppo. Analysts say the fall of Aleppo would be a big blow to the opposition, as it would leave the government in control of Syria's four largest cities. 
Its chairman, Mark Lindsay, has said confidence in the office of the ombudsman is at an all-time low. He also said the PSNI is in a state of crisis because of reducing budgets and officer numbers.

Rocky Taylor, a friend of 40 years standing, said the former BBC radio DJ and Crackerjack presenter had died in hospital in Bournemouth. Stewart's BBC Radio 2 colleagues were extremely saddened, he said, adding: "We are thinking of Ed's friends and family at this difficult time." "A lovely guy, loved his golf and he loved playing the songs on Junior Choice. "He was very, very good at that, and of course, on television." His former colleague and friend of 50 years, BBC DJ David Hamilton, said Stewart "was a little bit like a good wine; he just got better as time went on". "He was a really good guy, Ed, and I really will miss him." He was one of the first presenters on Radio 1 when it launched in 1967, and went on to become a regular Top of the Pops presenter in the 1970s. He was also a longstanding presenter of children's show Junior Choice, which last broadcast on BBC Radio 2 over Christmas. Former Radio 1 DJ and current Radio 2 broadcaster Simon Mayo wrote in a tweet: "How sad to hear of the passing of Ed Stewart. 
Three years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate. But when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way. Her vision for the party was to show how "economic and environmental justice are indivisible", she explains, "the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury". "It's a classic Shakespearean thing," she says of her struggles with the broadcast media. But, she adds, "when you get asked a stupid question, it's rather hard to know what to do at that point. "The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you," she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia. "I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits," she adds, but she believes British politics is "broken" and the media must take its share of the blame. There was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy. She was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on "brain freeze". "But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments. I should have just pulled the day but that's partly a function of how we got to that point.

This is the worst single loss of life for Russia since it launched its air offensive in Syria in support of President Assad towards the end of last year. It may not have been known to those who shot the helicopter down, as most of Russia's airpower in Syria has been used for military purposes to support pro-government forces. In July, two Russian pilots were killed when their helicopter was shot down east of the city of Palmyra by so-called Islamic State (IS). Last November, the pilot of a Russian Su-24 fighter plane was killed when the aircraft was shot down by Turkey on its border with Syria. On Sunday, rebel groups south of Aleppo launched a push to try to break the siege, in what observers said was one of the biggest counter-offensives in months.

A rugged, mountainous country, with lush valleys to the south and north, it is Central Asia's poorest nation. Tajiks are the country's largest ethnic group, with Uzbeks making up a quarter of the population, over half of which is employed in agriculture and just one-fifth in industry. The country is also dependent on oil and gas imports. Skirmishes with drug smugglers crossing illegally from Afghanistan occur regularly, as Tajikistan is the first stop on the drugs route from there to Russia and the West.

She was 12 at the time and living with her parents and two siblings in northern Peru. Japanese people began migrating to Peru in considerable numbers at the end of the 19th Century, drawn by opportunities to work in the mines and on sugar plantations. Ms Moore, a scholar at the Japanese Peruvian Oral History Project, says after the outbreak of World War Two, the Japanese community in Peru became a target, and their assets were confiscated. "In May 1940, as many as 600 houses, schools and businesses belonging to citizens of Japanese descent were burned down," she says. Records from the time suggest the US authorities wanted to take them to the US and use them as bargaining chips for its nationals captured by Japanese forces in Asia. Mr Katsura was among the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly deported to internment camps in the US. "He had been taken to Panama from where they were planning to send him to the US," she adds. Ms Katsura says she later learned that the camp authorities were keen for the children to learn Japanese so they would be able to speak the language once they were deported to Japan. Of the 2,200 Latin Americans of Japanese descent to be interned in the US, 800 were sent to Japan as part of prisoner exchanges.

Any political party would struggle to fend off accusations of racism, he told the BBC, but the party leader simply took them off the list and said they were not welcome. The party made it into parliament in 2010 with 5.7% of the vote, five years after Jimmie Akesson took on the leadership. The anti-immigration rhetoric has been toned down and carefully argued, with a policy of preferring to help refugees in their own countries. That does not mean the Sweden Democrats have shaken off their past but, with two MEPs in the European Parliament, they are now part of the same grouping as the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party - the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group. "One of Jimmie Akesson's skills is that he sends one message to the racists in his party and another to the general public."

Tory Anna Soubry, Labour's Chuka Umunna and Lib Dem Nick Clegg all want the UK to remain in the EU single market. The single market - which allows EU states to trade free of tariffs and other barriers - is central to the debate on what kind of deal the UK should seek when it leaves. EU leaders have said access to, or membership of, the single market is dependent on the UK continuing to accept the principle of free movement, while Downing Street says people voted for greater control over the UK's borders and says it will not compromise on immigration controls. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the EU said: "The government has been clear that we want to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market - and let European businesses do the same here. 
An official in Sintku township near the first quake's epicentre told Associated Press six people had died there, some of them workers at a gold mine that collapsed. He told Reuters that one woman had also died and 10 people had been injured in the nearby town of Kyauk Myaung after a house collapsed. There were many people in the road. In March 2011, at least 75 people died when a powerful earthquake hit Burma near the borders with Laos and Thailand. 
"There's absolutely a point in doing it next year," said McDermott. "It's a lot more than just three games of rugby. There's a lot of activity that goes on during the week that helps boost the profile of the sport and there's obviously a hunger for it from the broadcasters." 
A UK and Finnish team found those with more education were as likely to show the signs of dementia in their brains at death as those with less. The researchers found that more education makes people better able to cope with changes in the brain associated with dementia. But the researchers found those with more education are better able to compensate for the effects of the condition. Dr Hannah Keage of the University of Cambridge, who co-authored the study, said: "Previous research has shown that there is not a one-to-one relationship between being diagnosed with dementia during life and changes seen in the brain at death. "It could be that the types of people who study longer have large brains which adapt better to changes associated with dementia. 
"I am very familiar with the stretch of road in question and have travelled it many times. 
The predicted rise is above the UK average, which is expected to see an increase of 3% over the course of 2015. Northern Ireland's Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) rose 7% this year,  but house prices are still more than 40% below the peak of the boom. However, the market began to show signs of recovery in the latter half of 2013. 
The gap between Hong Kong's rich and poor is at a 30-year high, property rental prices have risen to record levels and residents are upset by daily news reports on corrupt lives of officials at the highest levels of Chinese government. An independent poll shows the Hong Kong public's mistrust of the Chinese government stands at a post handover high, largely because of a number of political scandals. Both decry the lack of opportunities and inadequate public housing in Hong Kong. Following the release of the census figures, Hong Kong's incoming Chief Executive CY Leung - who is to be sworn in on Sunday - announced he would chair a new preparatory task force to tackle poverty. The rally on Sunday is the annual human rights demonstration that traditionally starts at Victoria Park and ends at the Hong Kong government office in Admiralty. If it's not in Hong Kong's present, it's going to reflect on our future," said Claudia Mo, a member of the Civic Party. The other rally on Saturday, due to finish at the Hong Kong Exhibition Centre in Wanchai, is timed to coincide with Mr Hu's dinner plans. Although Mr Hu's visit in 2007 coincided with pro-democracy protests, the political climate in China and Hong Kong was different at that time. The country appeared to be edging ever so slightly closer to Hong Kong's core democratic values of clean government, the rule of law and freedom of speech. 
The world number one is only the fourth player after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan to claim back-to-back titles in the modern era. Selby was 47-0 up in the 31st frame, and leading 16-14 on frames, when he potted a red before attempting to roll up to the black ball. The decision was reversed but Moore looked at it from another angle and said he was not sure. Verhaas then said, "If you are not sure, I will stick to the original decision" and the foul stood. The third session was the turning point, a slow, turgid affair when he won six out of the seven frames to hold the advantage by two frames. A dreadful collapse for Higgins means he missed out on moving into second place on his own in the list of most ranking titles won and remains one behind O'Sullivan's five world victories. I'm proud of myself but he was too good on the day But the 41-year-old lost his way on the final day, and late breaks of 88 and 111 were not enough, as he was left frustrated by his rival's dogged performance. I'm proud of myself but he was too good on the day."

What worries Brian is that Britain might now vote to leave the European Union. It aims, they say, to persuade voters to stick with what they know and remain inside the EU. She's the chairwoman of the Costa del Sol branch of Conservatives Abroad, and insists that the party locally is united in wanting to remain inside the EU, unlike her political counterparts back home. It recently devoted a whole edition to the EU referendum, prompting many callers to sound off against the EU and all its works. Given the strength of opinion on this subject, it is perhaps surprising that so few expats in Spain have actually registered to vote, either in the forthcoming referendum, or indeed for any British elections. The British embassy in Spain has launched a campaign to persuade British expats to register for the vote, a campaign that is being mirrored in countries across the world. "The referendum is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to determine the future of our country.

Mr Modi coaxed the United Nations into declaring 21 June International Yoga Day and announced a grand event to be held in Delhi on that day. His government plans to get tens of thousands of people to perform yoga in the heart of the capital on Sunday. Mr Modi is an enthusiast himself - he told a biographer he tries to do yoga for an hour after waking up in the morning. Mr Modi's plan to get 35,000 people to perform yoga for 35 minutes on the stately Rajpath (King's Avenue) is aimed at setting a new Guinness World Record. Inspired by Mr Modi's call, even India's National Cadet Corps want to set another record on Sunday - "the largest ever demonstration of yoga by a uniformed organisation on a single day concurrently at multiple venues all across India". If Mr Modi's move encourages more Indians to take to yoga - with or without the spirituality attached to it - it would have served a purpose in making more Indians healthier. Mayawati, the feisty leader of India's Dalits (formerly known as untouchables) said Mr Modi's party and its hardline allies were trying to use yoga to "vitiate communal harmony". Some Muslim clerics are uneasy about the government's motives and equate Mr Modi's government's promotion of yoga with promoting Hinduism. Analyst Ajaz Ashraf says Mr Modi's yoga celebration is a "mix of cultural nationalism, commercialisation and subtle coercion". "Yoga is part of ancient India's cultural heritage," says Manmohan Vaidya, a spokesperson of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the hardline ideological godfather of the BJP and the largest Hindu nationalist group in India. Others say yoga is India's biggest contribution to society after, perhaps, zero and is a symbol of its cultural richness. But this, Doniger believes, ignores yoga's complex and contested history: there are at least five conflicting claims about when yoga began, including a provocative assertion by Mark Singleton that the roots of modern yoga actually do not lie in ancient India. In the end, as Doniger says, "for some people yoga is a religious meditation, for others an exercise routine, and for others, both". 
"I am in talks with a number of other chairmen to set up a meeting to bring a vote of no confidence in the leadership of the RFL," said Koukash. In a statement, the RFL responded: "As an organisation, we are here to work for the clubs and all those with an interest in rugby league. 
"I think he expected me to say 'take yourself off, I'm not having any GAA tree in the grounds of Stormont'," Mr Wilson said. "I actually thought it was a step forward, that here was a body which we regarded as a nationalist sporting body, wanting to be recognised in the grounds of the parliament of Northern Ireland. "He said 'there's a wee thing just to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the GAA'. He told the programme he was a "strong supporter" of devolution and it was "difficult decision" to choose between his jobs as an MP and a Stormont MLA.

The weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel. Divided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist. In its own words, the IPCC is there "to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts". In 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses. Although this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word "uncertainty" features heavily. Climate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide. "In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years," said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process. The panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report. But in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report. But the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m. The report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision. The state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions. The IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding: In the drafts of the latest report, the scientists say there is stronger evidence that ice sheets and glaciers are losing mass and sea ice cover is decreasing in the Arctic. Under the worst carbon emissions scenarios, an Arctic free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of this century is likely. "But, given the pace of both science and news, perhaps it is time the IPCC moved with the Twitter generation." Marcel Crok says the whole process of the IPCC is bad for the scientific principle of open argument.

In a lengthy and emotive statement, the Albanian FA condemned the "racist violence" of the Serbia players and "negative propaganda" of their FA. "The Serbian side seems unable to condemn the violence, extremism and racism that was displayed at Belgrade, but rather, they seem too busy weaving political statements that do not serve any purpose but to defend the shameful acts of racist violence and the unsportsmanlike conduct of their players, fans and security staff." "The incident itself and the behaviour of the Albanian players, coach and staff leaves no room for doubt that they were part of a synchronised plan to stop the match," the statement read. Much of the conflict relates to the former Serbian province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 and has a mainly Albanian population. 
Jurors heard exhibits stolen in Durham and Cambridge were valued at about £17m but detectives believed they could have fetched up to £57m on the "booming" Chinese auction market. A further seven members of the gang were jailed on Monday: "Because of the complexity we were only able to get a conspiracy to steal and that's capped at seven years, which is a bit of a shame." 
China missed out on a medal in the women's 4x100m medley relay on Sunday, coming fourth.

The protesters had gathered on the previous day, after the country's parliament unexpectedly passed a controversial law that granted official status to the Russian language in regions where it is predominantly spoken. Many here view the use of the Ukrainian language as central to the country's identity. Anything less is to surrender to the country's one-time cultural and political masters in Moscow - where many still view Ukraine as a Russian appendage - and ultimately threatens the country's continued independence. "This law is sending an incredibly powerful signal that the Ukrainian language is not needed," said Roman Tsupryk, a political commentator and chairman of the editorial board of the Ukrainian weekly "Tyzhden" (Week). People in the country's Russian-speaking east and south have a predictably different view on the matter. "Every time we have elections, the issue of language is there," said Oleh Rybachuk, a cabinet member in the previous government and now an independent analyst.

Her mum, Mariam, decided that Manar and her four sisters had no choice but to leave Syria after their neighbour's house was destroyed by a falling plane as war and fighting in the country got worse and worse. Manar added: "We were really scared from hearing all the missiles and the shooting. We could hear gunfire and see the airplanes in the sky. And it was in similar camps where Manar ended up after leaving her home. 
The Conservatives announced plans in 2007 to raise the inheritance tax threshold for passing on property and other assets to £1m. "This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house particularly in London and the south east paying inheritance tax." When he was shadow chancellor, George Osborne said the Conservatives would raise the Inheritance Tax threshold to £1m, the announcement coming in the autumn of 2007 amid speculation that the then prime minister Gordon Brown would call a snap election. Earlier this year, David Cameron said he would like to "go further" and take more families out of inheritance tax but warned about the cost of such a move. But speaking on Tuesday, Mr Cameron said inheritance tax was "not something in the Budget" and dismissed suggestions the Lib Dems were standing in the way of his plans. Nearly 16,000 estates were liable for inheritance tax in 2011-12 but this is projected to increase to 56,100 by the end of the next Parliament in 2020 as a result of house price inflation and the freeze in tax thresholds.

Of course, it's not easy to be a national team coach - you suffer a lot on the bench," he joked.

That is really unhelpful for their players at this stage of the season when they are trying to gain momentum and confidence, so Wenger has a big call to make - and he has to get it right. On their day, Arsenal's free-flowing football is good enough to destroy anyone and it does not matter who they play at the back. So I don't think Wenger will be overly concerned that will happen to his team every week, and he certainly will not be worried about it against Leicester. They will be desperate for three points from their first home game of the season, and a tried and tested line-up might be the way to get it. The Tigers sat deep and did not allow them to play to their strengths on the break but against Arsenal the game is far more likely to follow a pattern that suits Ranieri's fast attackers. He was visibly frustrated at missing the chances he got against Hull and, facing Arsenal, he will be determined to prove a point and show them why they wanted him. Yes, he also blazed one shot over the bar which is unlike him but he set himself ridiculously high standards last season and it will be very difficult for him to maintain that ratio. It is the same for any striker, and can happen for a variety of reasons but I do not see it becoming an issue for Vardy because the way he plays and the way his team plays means he is always going to get chances, including against Arsenal. The occasion is set up for him and, the way he is, it certainly would not surprise me if he goes and bangs in the winner.

Cosatu General Secretary of Bheki Ntshalintshali told a media briefing that the union's decision was driven by Mr Zuma's failure to consult it before making changes to his cabinet. He added that the organisation was not concerned about Mr Gordhan's sacking because he was, like his predecessors, "not a friend of the workers". Mr Zuma is due to step down in 2019 at the end of his second five-year term as president. Later, in a speech at the weekend, which has been interpreted as a public broadside against Mr Zuma, he called for a renewal of the country and criticised "greedy and corrupt people". Former President Kgalema Motlanthe also said that it was difficult for Mr Zuma to command respect after the constitutional court found him in breach of the law when he failed to repay government money spent on his private home.

The vessel was intercepted by Israeli naval ships off the coast of Gaza and forced to head south, the charity which chartered the ship said. An Al-Jazeera correspondent on board said that Israeli navy boats had formed a "wall" on one side of the Amalthea and forced it towards El-Arish. Israel's navy began shadowing the vessel overnight, after warning that it would not be allowed to break the naval blockade of Gaza. The Israeli military said the ship had run into engine trouble, but the ship's owner later told the BBC that it was a ploy by the captain to buy time for the Libyan charity to muster international support. It says this is necessary to stop weapons for Palestinian militant groups inside Gaza being smuggled in, and to put pressure on the Islamist movement Hamas, which controls the coastal territory. The blockade, maintained by Israel and Egypt, was widely described as "collective punishment" resulting in a humanitarian crisis for Gaza's 1.4 million people. Meanwhile, Israel's parliament voted on Tuesday to strip an Israeli Arab lawmaker of some key privileges for joining the flotilla of aid ships that tried to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza in May.

Though he never enjoyed the same pop success as such other country greats as Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard's success in the country charts was staggering. He was sent to, and escaped from, a variety of penal institutions. A love of singing and a concert by Johnny Cash, in 1958, inspired him to join the prison band. In the late 1960s, Haggard enjoyed success with several country classics, including I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am, and Silver Wings. He was a fine guitarist and even played the fiddle well. In 1996, Merle Haggard was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and in 2010 he was honoured at the White House's 33rd annual national celebration of the arts.

He has been called up to the England Under-20 squad for the first time and could make his debut later this month in the Toulon Tournament. 
She also said that lewd comments Donald Trump made about women that were caught on videotape were unacceptable but did not represent the man she knows. In the video, Mr Trump tells Mr Bush, who was then host of NBC's Access Hollywood, that he can force himself on women because he's a star. Reflecting on the 2005 Access Hollywood videotape leaked to the media 10 days ago, she said: "I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. Mr Trump, she said, "was led on - like, egged on - from the host to say dirty and bad stuff". She also justified her husband's tactic of appearing with the women who have accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault. 
But, as the self-immolations have slowed, we hoped to be better able to reach remote communities and speak to people. It's the home of pandas and spicy food. They know we have been in contact with locals trying to line up interviews and to prepare logistics for the trip. We explain that we are here at this specific time to film the annual movement of herdsmen who will drive their yaks up into the hills where they will live for the summer months. But the next day when we speak to those preparing to make the journey, the government will have its people listening in. So, for much of the year, people have televisions, fridges and electrical lights. But when the summer comes they head for the hills - back to the land of their forebears. "If we don't go to the summer grasslands and just stay in the winter fields there will be no food left for the yaks. The government official who had been standing in the field and listening to our interview suddenly disappears. Next to Kalsang Gyatso's place runs a recently laid tar road and along it the sound of hundreds of hooves can be heard. The Tibetans are on horseback, calling and whistling to keep their livestock moving. He says they must move now in order to make the most of new grass and provide for their families and that the dates for the journey are actually fixed by government regulations. It is being built smack in the middle of the main migration route and has already been opened. China's Tibetan areas have been hotbeds of rebellion in the past, with some blaming Beijing for restrictions on Tibetan Buddhism, language and culture. We board one of the buses and speak to those taking photos of the Tibetans riding along outside. They seem to have genuine affection for the people who call this place home and inside the adventure park they will come into contact with the Tibetans who have been employed here. "When city people come here they will also feel happy because of the fresh air and the smell of wildflowers. 
It said the change would deliver savings of up to Â£250m a year while allowing "greater control" over the network. Mr Kinchin-Smith said the interior of the box had been saved with a view to reconstructing it for future public display. 
•  If you have an IT supplier, check they are conducting regular backups of all your systems and that these are not connected to your network. SBRC's chief ethical hacker, Gerry Grant, said: "Thousands of computers were infected with the ransomware - and it was able to have such an impact because routine preventative measures had not been taken. "It can be too easy to put this off and click the 'remind me tomorrow' option. "We say it so often, but the prospect of a cyber-attack can be incredibly daunting for the less tech-savvy and the temptation can be to bury heads in the sand. 
Opener Haseeb Hameed, who missed the final Test of last winter's series defeat in India with injury, is overlooked after failing to reach 50 in 12 championship innings for Lancashire this summer. South Africa-born Jennings, who made a century on his Test debut, averages 36 in Division Two for Durham this term. Bowling in boots specially designed to combat the impact on his heel, he took 4-33 against Australia in the Champions Trophy in June and has eight wickets in three championship matches for Durham this year. Slow left-armer Dawson, who took 1-29 on his debut in the final Test in Chennai last year, has 18 wickets at 30 apiece in Division One this summer. This is a change to the plan at the start of the season due to Hameed's loss of form and, while Jennings hasn't been pulling up many trees for Durham, the fact he played in the last Test before Christmas indicates consistency. 
That is one of the findings from an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC from ORB International that examines public opinion in both Iraq and Syria. Some 66% of those questioned in Iraq and 57% in Syria think their country is heading in the wrong direction. Perhaps more shocking is that one quarter of those questioned in Iraq and more than one third in Syria think their country is actually on the right track. think the country is going in the wrong direction But what is fascinating is that it was possible to conduct this opinion poll at all - especially given the continuing violence in Iraq and the chaos in war-torn Syria. "In the IS-controlled areas of Raqqa for each survey we visit the head of the town and ask him for permission to randomly interview people," Mr Heald says. Because, as the data verifies, many of those living in Raqqa now are happier since IS took over. think the country is going in the wrong direction As Mr Heald said, the survey suggests that "the majority in both countries are opposed to IS but that they also think that IS is a product of foreign countriesâ€¦ which to you and I may seem like some crazy conspiracy theory but to them it is a common perception. People aren't leaving Raqqa now because of IS - they are leaving because of the coalition air strikes."

The Tories claim 94% of working households are better off under the tax and benefit changes coming into effect. "Families are £1,100 a year worse off on average - that is the true cost of a Tory chancellor," he said, citing independent figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies which he said supported his case. He said the IFS figures took into account all of the changes David Cameron and his government had introduced since May 2010 up until Monday, including the change to the personal allowance. David Cameron and George Osborne will both be out campaigning in the South West on the day tax changes affecting millions of voters take effect. So Mr Cameron will point out that more than 90% of working households will be better off under the changes which come in today, largely due to the rise in the amount we can earn before we pay tax. Labour has countered that families are on average £1,100 a year worse off because of the tax and welfare changes since 2010; much of this is due to benefit cuts. David Cameron will say there is not just an economic case but a moral case for low taxes, saying this goes to the heart of what he believes in as a Conservative. The Tories need to save £30bn to eliminate the deficit by 2017/18 and if they won't put up taxes, all the money will have to come from spending cuts. 
Kyrgios subsequently said he was "truly sorry" and would use this time during his suspension "to improve on and off the court". "We wanted to hold [Kyrgios] to his contract," the Dutchman told the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting. Kyrgios represented his country at youth level as a basketball player, and said in an interview in June 2015 that he preferred the sport to tennis. Asked then if he might have had a career in basketball, Kyrgios said: "I thought I was going to. 
But when a BBC reporter met Mr Sheill he was the only person holding the consultations. The GMC were shown footage of a consultation between Mr Sheill and a BBC reporter, in which he recommended treatments and bragged "I did 11 people's botox yesterday". A GMC spokesman confirmed by misleading patients in this way Mr Sheill has "potentially breached Section 49 of the Medical Act", which is a criminal offence. 
A second bench is also planned at the Cardiff City Academy training ground and the club hopes the match will become an annual event. 
Addressing delegates, Mr Flanagan said: "It has been interesting to read recently some right-wing commentators having a specific go at the EIS, with one demanding that the first minister should 'take on the EIS'. But he said the union was "well aware of the attainment gap" and was working jointly with the Scottish government on issues regarding child poverty. Teachers' pay is negotiated nationally through a joint body which involves unions, councils and the Scottish government. 
Access difficulties meant an RAF helicopter was needed to get him out. 
As it turns out, the first bit of concrete public evidence that someone in the president's inner circle might be open to Russian assistance in the presidential election involved Mr Trump's eldest son. Nestled toward the end of music publicist Goldstone's explosive first email to Trump Jr about the "official documents and information" the Russian government supposedly had about Hillary Clinton was that this constituted just "part of" Russia's support for his father, "helped along by Aras and Emin" Agalarov, the father-son Moscow-based real estate duo. That kind of remark, however, would cause anyone looking for evidence of a Trump-Russia campaign collusion to stop dead in their tracks and ask: "What's the rest of the story?" In other words, Veselnitskaya walked out of that meeting in New York with the belief that Mr Trump's campaign both was desperately seeking damaging information about Mrs Clinton and were open to talking to Russian nationals about what they might have to offer. After a fair bit of wrangling the two apparently spoke, and the very next email was Goldstone informing Trump Jr he was scheduling the meeting with the "Russian government attorney" (Veselnitskaya) for later in the week. Mr Mueller and congressional investigators may be interested in learning what Agalarov said that convinced Mr Trump to move ahead with the plans for a face-to-face gathering. And what was the nature of the relationship between Agalarov and the Trump clan, in light of Goldstone's observation that Emin and his father were helping Russia's support of the Trump campaign? Was this an indication that the elder Trump may have known about the meeting - which, according to Trump Jr, did not produce the promised dirt on Mrs Clinton? 
It is estimated that 40,000 of 300,000 children born to foreign citizens in the US each year are the product of birth tourism, according to figures quoted in court documents filed to obtain search warrants for the schemes. Even though the women were paying birth tourism operators between $15,000 and $50,000 for their service, they paid local hospitals nothing or a reduced sum for uninsured, low-income patients, according to the affidavit.

Frank and Mary Finlay bought Molly in November 2015 thinking she was female. He mentioned it to the vet at Mr Allan's Pollokshaws surgery and they raised possibility of Molly being hermaphrodite. Mr Finlay says: "They did scans and x-rays and eventually she was operated on in May 2016 at six months old." "What transpired was that although Molly looked to be female, her urethra followed the route as though she was a boy. The vet says that as time went on Molly "was starting to get interested in soft cushions" and behave more like a male dog. The surgery removed the "vestigial" penis and created a female opening in Molly's groin. "That was quite frightening but she came through it," says Mrs Finlay. Mr Allan says: "Molly is Molly and she is happy and fit and healthy, that is the main thing."

Mr Denton said the 2007 Gawker article was not the only reason Mr Thiel disliked the media. 
A Kensington Palace statement said they were prompted to take action after the man was spotted near the 14-month-old and his nanny in a central London park. Lawyers for the photographer, Niraj Tanna, said he had done nothing wrong and would continue with his work. The statement from the palace said there was "reason to suspect that the individual may have been placing Prince George under surveillance and monitoring his daily routines for a period of time." It adds: "He will continue to undertake his work with the concerns of the Prince's parents very much in mind." The statement from the Kensington Palace said: "The duke and duchess understand the particular public role that Prince George will one day inherit but while he is young, he must be permitted to lead as ordinary a life as possible."

Sudanese papers are painting his return as the final nail in the ICC's coffin after years of failing to have him arrested. Al-Watan's editorial thanks South Africa and the AU for proving they are "strong willed in confronting the new colonialism." But a commentator in the Cape Argus paper is worried that South Africa's need to win friends and influence others in Africa is trumping its international obligations. "Hopefully, the courts remain the beacon of hope and ensure that South Africa is held to its international obligations, and that there are consequences for it not doing so. "This could not have happened without the complicity of the South African government, which deserves international condemnation," it says in an editorial. 
Alan McBride, from the victims' group Wave, said although police had acted within the law at the time, there was a "moral obligation" to inform relatives. Meanwhile, the mother of a murdered schoolgirl - who had consented to the retention of part of her daughter's body as part of the police investigation - said it was very important that families were told the truth. Mrs McAlorum said the PSNI had kept her family informed "every step of the way" and had fully explained the need to retain the teenager's head as evidence. Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said the PSNI had acted within the law and that all the items had been retained for "police purposes", but he admitted relatives should have been informed. He said police were satisfied that there was a "good reason" for retaining the items, a decision that was largely based on the judgement of pathologists. "One would be that it would assist or help us determine the precise cause of death, and the other one would be for evidential purposes," he said. 
The two-time world champion and team-mate Danielle Huskisson, who was 35th, will have a second opportunity to qualify for Rio at the Olympic qualification event in Portugal in June next year.

Throughout the 1970s and 80s, they operated an "abhorrent" predatory paedophile ring in the Wrexham area of north Wales. "That's the whole nature of a paedophile ring; they pick on people who have vulnerability, they don't necessarily have a very stable home life and people looking after them so they are prey to offenders of this nature. "But there's still much more to be done because the evidence is that there are hundreds and hundreds of people who've been abused that have never come forward, often abuse within their own families. Mr King and officers on the National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial team - set up in 2012 after Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an investigation into claims of previously overlooked child abuse in north Wales - have repeatedly paid tribute to the five victims. "No phone evidence, no CCTV, the usual supporting evidence is not available in a case of this nature so it comes down in the end to the oral testimony of the witnesses and of course the defendants have their say and it's for the jury to make up their mind whether they can be sure on the evidence they hear." The victims told the jury how they had been abused mostly at the home of Gary Cooke - also known as Mark Grainger - who has a string of sex convictions. They were taken into this network of people and it's been difficult to escape that cycle." He added: "They accessed their victims in a variety of ways. Some of the boys would then introduce their friends to the men. So the latest chapter in the scandal of child abuse in north Wales, both inside and outside the care system in the 70s and 80s, comes to a close. 
For the Scots and their much talked-about revival, this was perspective. It wasn't just a slap in the face, it was a kick to the solar plexus and a proper shoeing in the aftermath. They got over for their seventh try with the last play and they deserved it. For the Scots, it was a form of sporting torture. In this Six Nations there hasn't been much, if any, evidence of frailties in the Scotland midfield but Jones saw some and, Lord, how England executed. They threw a dummy runner at Alex Dunbar and Huw Jones, a little bit of deception that created a very large hole and the opening try for Jonathan Joseph. The might of Twickenham closed in on them. Brown came back on to the field, overthrew his first line-out and suddenly it was 13-0. Joseph raced through the Scottish midfield for a second one-phase try after 25 minutes and in that moment a giant jumbo jet appeared in the skies above Twickenham. Seymour went off, Duncan Weir came on and he became Scotland's third full-back of the day. Jones scored again and like a cat with a mouse England responded, Danny Care bringing up the half-century that put this victory into the history books. For the weary visitors, it was torture. In the end, it was their worst kind of nightmare. 
There have been a number of recent developments in relation to the M4. Leanne Wood also told me in an interview at the Plaid spring conference in Llanelli that she would refuse to consider any kind of deal with Labour, whether a formal coalition or an informal arrangement, so long as it was considering an investment of Â£1bn on the black route. The Conservatives have given us their pre-election position, which is not to have a position on whether it should be the blue or the black route. What's fascinating about the M4 relief road is that it stands in stark contrast to the metro rail scheme, which will form part of the new Cardiff city deal.

He said Wales, in terms of geography, was close to GCHQ's base in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and could exploit its technology base and build on digital skills, offering local business opportunities. "It's really important everyone invests the time, energy and effort to focus on the topic," he said. "There are huge economic benefits in cyber security and we really want Wales to be at the heart of exploiting that. 
However, the new show is not envisaged as a successor to Top of the Pops and its top 40 format. BBC Music's Jan Younghusband suggested it would be a successor to one-off specials like Adele at the BBC and Michael Buble at the BBC. There should be a show like that and we'd love to be the ones to make it." The new BBC series will have Fulwell 73's Gabe Turner and former TFI Friday producer Suzi Aplin as executive producers, with more details to be announced in the summer. 
He was invited to audition for London's Royal Opera House in 1956, where he made his debut the following year. In 1958, he debuted at the Bayreuth Festival as Siegmund in Wagner's Die Walkuere (The Valkyrie), which launched his international career and become one of his signature roles. He achieved his greatest fame in the 1960s, as part of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, with his critically acclaimed performances of Tristan in Wagner's Tristan and Isolde and the eponymous Peter Grimes.

The women were taken into police custody last week in the run-up to International Women's Day on Sunday. The irony is that the activists were detained for trying to promote women's rights to mark International Women's Day. The campaigners held similar activities to mark International Women's Day in the past and faced no troubles. Women's rights are high on this year's agenda - with the legislative session expected to pass a landmark domestic violence law. Over the weekend, female representatives of the congress held a news conference on gender equality and women's rights issues in China. 
The voting project, called My Digital Rights, marks the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta and the 25th birthday of the world wide web. "It has been fascinating to see how the public's top clauses have compared to those of the thousands of students who have co-created this 'Magna Carta for the digital age'," says Sarah Shaw, the British Library's project manager of Magna Carta: My Digital Rights. "The project was conceived to encourage young people to think about issues of privacy, access and freedom, raised by Magna Carta, in the digital age.

If confirmed, the "exomoon" is likely to be about the size and mass of Neptune, and circles a planet the size of Jupiter but with 10 times the mass. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light. A current theory of planetary formation suggests such an object is unlikely to have formed in place with its Jupiter-mass planet, but would instead be an object captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of this planetary system. The researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one. A handful of possible candidates have come to light in the past, but none as yet has been confirmed.

Mr Cameron said he had not heard the remark but he had little doubt about Britain's standing in the world and its outstanding contribution in a wide range of fields. "Britain is an island that has helped to clear the European continent of fascism and was resolute in doing that throughout World War II. He added: "For the people who live in Northern Ireland, I should say we are not just an island, we are a collection of islands. He repeated the speech at a press conference at the close of the two-day summit, adding in references to The Beatles, Shakespeare, Elgar and latest pop sensations One Direction. But the MP was slapped down by Mr Cameron, who told reporters in St Petersburg:  "I'm not a regular follower of Twitter, but insulting people should never have a part in foreign policy."
